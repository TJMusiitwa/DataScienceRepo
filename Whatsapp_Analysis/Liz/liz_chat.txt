30/12/2017, 23:56 - TJ Musiitwa: I didn't wish to forget my end of year message to my sweetest
30/12/2017, 23:56 - TJ Musiitwa: That point in time again, we come to the close of another year and prepare to mark a new one. Along which is meant to come new experiences, potentially new friends and new memories. However before we do, we should remember the old ones.
 
2017 has marked another year of growth for me in many ways. Completed level 2 of university, finally turned 20...marked one year anniversary with my wonderful girlfriend, finally got to visit home....made new friends...lost old ones really has been a growth year.

But can't forget to give much love and shout out to my best cheerleader...my spirit raiser...the reason for my quiet happy moments...the reason for my many fantasies...the person that has listened to me... bringing as much joy to me as I do for her (maybe she gives me even more than I give her).
Either way I am overjoyed to have this lady in my life, yes you Elizabeth you are all these things and more to me in my life.
A year anniversary we marked and we are ever so close to our 2nd. I am glad that we made it thus far and can't wait for what awaits us over the course of the new year.
I just want to say thank you. Thank you for being born to fill my life with joy and love, for a smile like yours that radiates nothing but the warmest love. The kindest personality that just can't help but be loved.
Thank you for the surprise calls you have made to me all this year (even when they were at such an expense to you), you can't imagine the impact and effect they had on me, *immensely positive effect*. 

I congratulate you upon sticking  and working hard to complete high school. Sure there were rough days rough times, u were a champ and worked through them all. Success is within your grasp as we await your results this coming 2nd quarter.

All this and more I can only say as much or put into writing. Remind me to hug you next time to symbolise all that I might have forgotten or couldn't say in this message.

I wish you a happiest of new years and hope the best for you all throughout 2018.

All my love to you and for you,
Jonathan 💖💕

06/01/2018, 23:31 - Liz: 😊😊😊
06/01/2018, 23:36 - Liz: BTW cud u please clarify this.. Wat is Ur definition of true love
06/01/2018, 23:42 - TJ Musiitwa: That would require a long paragraph, give me some time... gotta do the dishes then when am done I'll return to this message
06/01/2018, 23:43 - Liz: U do the dishes..!!
07/01/2018, 00:27 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha did you think I just sit around home and do nada
07/01/2018, 00:27 - TJ Musiitwa: Course not....dishes are my way of contributing to the household
07/01/2018, 00:29 - TJ Musiitwa: What is true love....it had many forms but how does one know it it is true.
We each define true love in different ways. But to me I think true love is finding that person that just complements you.
07/01/2018, 00:31 - TJ Musiitwa: True love is knowing that I might not be wealthy now but that if you see the hard work n effort I put in now you stand by me and support me to reach that point where we are wealthy
07/01/2018, 00:32 - Liz: Ohhh.. My brother wouldn't do that even in his dreams
     So I get to do.the dishes.  Food.. Mop the house.. Wash.. Blah blah
07/01/2018, 00:33 - TJ Musiitwa: True love is having patience to discover something in someone worth it and be ready to cultivate that thing n make it bloom
07/01/2018, 00:36 - TJ Musiitwa: And finally I believe that true love is honest in that it will hear the ugly side of someone ... The real hidden stuff and if it comes out and it is too much to handle...true love knows that it is best to leave B4 getting hurt
As well as if that baggage is not too much to handle, then true love accepts it and finds a way to contribute to either aid or support it
07/01/2018, 00:39 - TJ Musiitwa: Also true love *is not perfect*
That explains itself
07/01/2018, 00:39 - TJ Musiitwa: So yeah that is what true love is to me:
Patient
Honest
Supportive
Not perfect

Surely there is alot more that can be said but I think it will all fall under these 4 categories..in whatever shape or form
07/01/2018, 00:40 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha you never know what is in his dreams...
07/01/2018, 00:41 - TJ Musiitwa: Generally you do it all n he does nothing??
Well that isn't respectfully right to the ladies in the house
07/01/2018, 00:41 - Liz: 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽.. Wow..🤗🤗🤗 interesting..

07/01/2018, 00:44 - Liz: Well I CNT promise all that.. But I *hope*(I don't promise... ) I can love u unconditionally and honestly.. Even wen the distance between us increases.. I *hope* to be hia

07/01/2018, 11:10 - TJ Musiitwa: You don't have to do all this...you have to work on your own definition of true love and work towards that....and hope that it best fulfills all that you believe in true love
07/01/2018, 11:11 - TJ Musiitwa: It can be what I wrote down it can be your own definition...but either way as long as the love you give out returns to you then it is fulfilled

WHAT A MOTHER TOLD HER SON A
DAY BEFORE HIS WEDDING

Mummy’s boy, you are now a man. Tomorrow
you will have a new mother, a new cook and a new person to share all your secrets with. It will no longer be me but her. 

Love your new mum even more than you love me. Before you walk into her arms forever, let me give you some words to guide you.


There was a day I was arguing with your father.


We were screaming, Tempers were high. I was angry and He was angry. Then I called him an idiot! He was shocked, 


He looked at me asking
how dare I call him that. Immediately I started calling him idiot, fool, stupid, crazy; I called him all sort of name. 


Guess what he did? He didn’t raise his hands to hit me. He just walked away, banging the door as he went out.


My Son, If your father had hit me and destroyed my eyes, how will you feel sitting here with me today? How will you regard him as your father?


Would you have been proud of him or would
you be blaming me for calling him names?


Never hit your wife! No matter the provocation
just walk away and things will be normal.


Whenever she offends you, think of this story I
just told you, it could have been your mum!


After he left, I was filled with guilt. We slept on same bed that night and I went to him the next day. 

I pleaded with him, I did all I could to show am sorry and he forgave me. That day I cooked his favourite food, yes you know he loves Pounded yam & Vegetable soup right? 


After that day, I never called him names, my respect for him was ten times stronger.


There is something very important you must always do, my son listen very carefully, defend your wife. When she is under pressure, stand by her. If your friends hates her, it is your duty to make them see her as a Queen. Your Uncle, I mean Uncle Yusuf, never liked me. 

But Ur father was always supportive until his perception changed.


There was a day your Father was going to host the owner of his company and friends. They were three of them. 


That day I was in the
kitchen cooking for them and your father went to buy drinks. 

When the table was set and food was served. 

Everyone started eating. Then I
remembered I did not add salt in the food. I
was embarrassed. 


Your father tasted the food and looked at me. He immediately turned to the guests. He told them that he instructed his wife last month not to add salt whenever she is cooking because of some problem with his body.


He said it in a funny way and everyone laughed!


The guests understood and he asked me to
bring salt and everyone added according to their taste. He managed to eat the food without salt.


After the guest left, he went on his knees and
asked God to forgive him for lying.


Your wife is like a baby, sometimes she don’t
know what to say or do. Stand up and speak for her!


Now let me talk to you about Sex. You see Sex
is a wonderful thing. 


Do not be surprised if your wife enjoy and need Sex more than you do.


There were days, I needed Sex more than your father and there were days he needed it more than me but the important thing is to always try to satisfy the other when they need you. 

Don’t always think of your self.


There was a time things were hard and I
needed to do two jobs to support your father.
One night I was so tired. When I got to bed he was in the mood. He try to make love to me and I didn’t refuse him. I was tired but I felt I needed to be there when he needs me. 

When he tried undressing me, he saw my look and he stopped. He asked what was wrong and I said nothing. But he understand me better. 
He stopped and then started telling me stories until I fell asleep.


My son, Sex is best enjoyed when the two
parties are physically and mentally ready for it.


Sometimes, read your wife and understand her.


Make it a habit to go anywhere with your wife. Beside your job, move around with her. 


If anyone invite you to his house and told you not to come with your wife then be very careful.
Use wisdom.


I know you love mummy… I know you will tell me all your problems. But now things will be different.


Let your wife be the first to know before me. Let her be the first to see before me.


When you have problems with her don’t run to me immediately. 

Wait for a day to pass and then talk to her about it. Pray about it. 

Report her to nobody but talk issues out within yourself.


Finally, don’t forget to come and visit me with
your wife every month!


I know you will have a happy home. 

You will always be mummy’s boy. 

God will bless Ur
home. 

Pls don't forget God, pray & seek His
assistance always..

10/01/2018, 00:17 - TJ Musiitwa: So you also have to wait till 20 and maybe she'll be chill
10/01/2018, 00:17 - TJ Musiitwa: Pretty much
10/01/2018, 00:17 - TJ Musiitwa: All that and more
10/01/2018, 00:18 - Liz: And BTW butterflies are harsh😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆 ask me
10/01/2018, 00:19 - Liz: Lemme ask how old is this Gerl nd the guy she needs to introduce
10/01/2018, 00:19 - Liz: Like next yr u mean...
10/01/2018, 00:19 - TJ Musiitwa: Hehe
10/01/2018, 00:20 - TJ Musiitwa: I don't know just heard the story that way
10/01/2018, 00:21 - TJ Musiitwa: Pretty much
10/01/2018, 00:21 - Liz: Hmm..
10/01/2018, 00:22 - Liz: Ooo.. Lemme reread
10/01/2018, 00:29 - Liz: Well i think its unfair to the dude... Simply because his the protagonist..um not sure about this but I read somewhere that if a guy cheats its understandable.. But if a babe cheats its just not okay...
So um thinking that this guy invested a lot to impress the babe but his hurt in the end.. So walk away.. Wipe it all off and start afresh..
10/01/2018, 00:30 - Liz: Or he could just listen to the babes explanation.. If its valid.. He can reconsider.. But by the time she's with sm1 else she never really loved him to wait for him
10/01/2018, 00:32 - Liz: Or she cud HV insisted to introduce him to the mum.. My mum would understand and encourage u to be strong.  Even during temptations.. I think
10/01/2018, 00:32 - Liz: Bottom line.. Its unfair.. To the mahn
10/01/2018, 00:34 - TJ Musiitwa: I see your pers
10/01/2018, 00:34 - TJ Musiitwa: Perspective

10/01/2018, 00:36 - TJ Musiitwa: A very smart lady
10/01/2018, 00:37 - Liz: Hmmmmm....
10/01/2018, 00:38 - Liz: patience is the it thing I guess.. And determination.. If u love u love.. Okay that only applies to me
10/01/2018, 00:38 - Liz: Not that gerl

15/01/2018, 00:34 - TJ Musiitwa: We were just kids when we fell in love....
And these 2 kids have made it to the 2nd year after 365 days we are back here ready to ride the journey all over again as the journey to the 3rd comes along.

This gets to be a good and fantastic anniversary because I am actually in the same time zone to celebrate it with you.
The 2nd year has just been a continuation and a growth of what we already have together, what we already know is a real thing. 2017 has been the time we have loved even more than the last, we have expressed ourselves more than the last.
It was the time where I have come to see you become even more loving and made sure that you cement yourself in my heart and in my life.

This year I would like to continue improving myself, to show you how best you can be loved...how you need to be loved. May this year allow me to be extraordinary for you and only you.

You call me your *constant reminder of the extraordinary* but you should know that to me you are *my constant reminder of beauty in the world*.  Thank you for another year of happiness and joy and love. I look forward to the next 365 days of loving you best I can, the only way I can.
 
To the next 365 after the 730, for the is no Toria if not with you.
All my love to you,
Happy anniversary Elizabeth,
Jonathan.

On the sixth day of severe  hunger, the helper fall sick with no hope of any medical treatment  or rescue, the sailors planned to eat the helper since he was going to die anyway and they successfully went through with the plan. The two survived death for the next three days by feeding on the helpers body until they were rescued on the forth day, the rescue police realizing that there was a dead body on the boat, they questioned  the sailors  who told them what transpired. The two have been charged with murder before court, if your the trial judge before this case, how would you handle this case and what are your reasons. (Give us your personal thought)

01/02/2018, 12:17 - Liz: Sm babe.. She allows to become a surrogate for sm couple..but she actually wants to become the wife to the guy since his rich and all
..

01/02/2018, 12:18 - Liz: Bt I look so Brown... Hmmmm
01/02/2018, 12:19 - TJ Musiitwa: Hehe quite intriguing...
01/02/2018, 12:21 - Liz: Hmmmm
01/02/2018, 12:24 - TJ Musiitwa: You wouldn't do such a thing... go be a surrogate for someone even if they paid you millions
01/02/2018, 12:26 - Liz: I don't think I wud.. Its so hard carrying a child 9months and in the end its taken away
01/02/2018, 12:29 - TJ Musiitwa: And even though it is someone else's child they will always be a part of you...yeah it's quite something
01/02/2018, 12:40 - Liz: So um wondering.. Wch xtr the child takes.. The surrogate mom o the other mum
01/02/2018, 12:42 - TJ Musiitwa: I think the baby takes a bit of everything cause if I recall correctly the fertilised egg is the one planted in the uterus...so already has both mum and dad's chromosomes and DNA and all that....but maybe there is a little chance that some of the surrogates genes also come into play....I think I'll have to double check on that
01/02/2018, 12:48 - Liz: Hoho.. Alright thanks..
01/02/2018, 12:49 - Liz: But its scary also
01/02/2018, 12:50 - TJ Musiitwa: I am sure it is
01/02/2018, 12:51 - Liz: But thea pipo willing to do so
01/02/2018, 12:52 - TJ Musiitwa: Mostly do it for money....I mean just paid to carry someone else's child and they are taking care of you...if you're broke it does sound like a straw to grasp into
01/02/2018, 12:55 - TJ Musiitwa: Onto
01/02/2018, 13:37 - Liz: Year we CNT blame them

02/02/2018, 20:51 - TJ Musiitwa: OK
02/02/2018, 20:52 - TJ Musiitwa: Cause I wouldn't want you to be afraid of me
02/02/2018, 20:52 - TJ Musiitwa: that is sending a wrong message in a relationship
02/02/2018, 20:54 - Liz: Um not
02/02/2018, 20:55 - Liz: But I don't..I promise
02/02/2018, 20:55 - TJ Musiitwa: Oki doki
02/02/2018, 21:01 - Liz: How did  this cross Ur mind
02/02/2018, 21:04 - TJ Musiitwa: Well to be very honest with you as I should be
02/02/2018, 21:07 - TJ Musiitwa: This came to my mind was it yesterday, when I was telling you about the questions
02/02/2018, 21:08 - TJ Musiitwa: And I was like send voice messages and all that, but you were not feeling up to them and tried, over the phone call, to get out of like doing that..
02/02/2018, 21:10 - TJ Musiitwa: So to me it was like let me not force her into it or over bear down on it. So I was thinking maybe as you were asking not to do the voice messages you were kinda like scared of what I would think or do or something like that
02/02/2018, 21:11 - TJ Musiitwa: But I quickly came to the realization of something important
02/02/2018, 21:12 - TJ Musiitwa: I am not likely to find another great wonderful girl like you ever
02/02/2018, 21:12 - TJ Musiitwa: And that patience is a virtue that yields great outcomes
02/02/2018, 21:13 - TJ Musiitwa: And if one is not willing to be patient in a relationship, then there is not really love in the 
1st place
02/02/2018, 21:14 - TJ Musiitwa: (taking you back to that time where I told you how I define what love is)
I think it was you or someone else....but yeah
02/02/2018, 21:17 - TJ Musiitwa: Either way I understood two things: I have a great girlfriend that is a fact n that I should maintain my aspect of being patient with her.
I will honour that commitment to continue being patient with you.... though certain times I might forget it, I will always be sure to keep pushing forward
02/02/2018, 21:17 - TJ Musiitwa: That what might be coal today, will be a diamond tomorrow
02/02/2018, 21:18 - TJ Musiitwa: So yeah that is that
02/02/2018, 21:18 - Liz: Eeehh okay
02/02/2018, 21:24 - Liz: Honestly sorry.. About that...
I just don't know how to ansa qtns just verbally.. I just don't.. Yet I wanted to ansa them from my perspective... Even if it was sm1 else.. I couldn't
02/02/2018, 21:25 - Liz: Um not even sure wat to say
02/02/2018, 21:36 - TJ Musiitwa: Hihi
02/02/2018, 21:36 - TJ Musiitwa: Naah it's good
02/02/2018, 21:36 - TJ Musiitwa: Don't beat yourself up about it
02/02/2018, 21:37 - TJ Musiitwa: We continue to learn and evolve each other
02/02/2018, 21:38 - TJ Musiitwa: As I said I understand how you feel about these things
02/02/2018, 21:39 - TJ Musiitwa: And it should not cause you any worry that I'll be mad about this....not in the least bit....
02/02/2018, 21:39 - TJ Musiitwa: What it means is that I get to talk alot more....cause apparently I can talk too much😅😅😅
02/02/2018, 21:40 - TJ Musiitwa: It's us and we shall be very very fine, better than than fine even, we shall be alright

08/02/2018, 17:01 - TJ Musiitwa: 👍🏾
08/02/2018, 17:26 - TJ Musiitwa: Beautiful attracts handsome,
Amazing attracts wonderful,
Loving attracts Serenity
And Elizabeth, you attracted me.
Some might believe in destiny,others might not,
(I for one am not sure in which camp I fall under),
But know this for sure,
All the times I think about you, I am always thinking 
about the future with you, not the past, not the present
But the future, because if the future is one that
does not have you in it, then I am not sure if that
is a future that will be happy for me with anyone else.

For if we are the stuff dreams are made of then, surely
WE ARE THE LOVE THAT A RELATIONSHIP IS BUILT ON...
Me and You💕

09/02/2018, 18:14 - TJ Musiitwa: So anywho what you up to today??
09/02/2018, 18:24 - TJ Musiitwa: Sometimes it is not the reasons we cry that make us weak
It is the reasons we love that bring the tears of 
joy on our faces,
Sometimes it is not the aching of our hearts that 
has reason to make us sad
It is the longing of two souls that have found each other,
calling to each other over great distances...
Even though we are separated by distances,
our hearts, our tears, our sadness, our longing, 
are all memories that we share, that makes it all the
worthwhile

Because if I know it is you at the other end of the line
my heart will leap out of its chest,
my tears will turn into joy,
my sadness into happiness,
my longing into the drive to fight for it.

For this love we have, is worth fighting for till the very end

10/02/2018, 18:31 - Liz: Soooo
10/02/2018, 18:31 - TJ Musiitwa: Hey there, So what does it say about one born in the year of the rabbit??
10/02/2018, 18:31 - TJ Musiitwa: Well
 Lucky colors: red, pink, purple, blue
Lucky numbers: 3, 4, 6
10/02/2018, 18:31 - TJ Musiitwa: The Rabbit personality:
Rabbits tend to be gentle, quiet, elegant, and alert; quick, skillful, kind, and patient; and particularly responsible. However, they might be superficial, stubborn, melancholy, and overly-discreet. Generally speaking, people who belong to the Rabbit zodiac sign have likable characters
10/02/2018, 18:31 - TJ Musiitwa: Ladies belonging to the rabbit zodiac sign, apart from a pretty and demure appearance, have a pure heart.
10/02/2018, 18:31 - TJ Musiitwa: Another part of your personality is that rabbits are faithful to those around them, but reluctant to reveal their minds to others, and have a tendency to escape reality. They are too cautious and conservative, which means they miss good opportunities.
10/02/2018, 18:31 - TJ Musiitwa: In terms of which type of rabbit ypu might be....(yup there are even types of rabbits), you are an *Earth* rabbit with claim to characteristics such as being Frank, straightforward, ambitious, hard-working, but slightly reserved
10/02/2018, 18:31 - TJ Musiitwa: And you share the zodiac with some famous people such as Queen Victoria, Brad Pitt and Lionel Messi🤷🏾‍♂😄
10/02/2018, 18:31 - TJ Musiitwa: Career-wise:
With a pair of dexterous hands, Rabbits have a gift for calligraphy and painting, as well as tailoring and cooking. Owning a *patient temperament*, they are able to manage everything to people's wishes.
10/02/2018, 18:31 - TJ Musiitwa: The best careers for Rabbits are cultivation, breeding, education, religion, health care, medicine, culture, police/judiciary work, and politics.
10/02/2018, 18:31 - TJ Musiitwa: Unlucky color: dark brown, dark yellow, white
Unlucky numbers: 1, 7, and 8
10/02/2018, 18:49 - TJ Musiitwa: Today, I do not seem to have words to write for you but I will try to come up with something abstract and simple, hopefully is it worth while....
10/02/2018, 18:57 - Liz: Breeding!!!!
10/02/2018, 18:57 - TJ Musiitwa: If someone says your name, the first thought that pops into my head is your smile, cause that is what I first came to recognise and love about you,
Then comes how beautiful you look, cause truthfully that beauty is Heaven sent,
Then comes the joy you bring to my life, my sunshine
Then comes the love you share, the sense of need and belonging I feel to  have you and love you back...
There is so much that could be said about you...
But I know this for sure, there will not be another Elizabeth like you in my life or anywhere...
To my love, you were made imperfectly perfect...
💕Mainest
10/02/2018, 18:57 - Liz: Not all of us
10/02/2018, 18:59 - Liz: Conservative... 😅😁😁 maybe.. Not fully

hope that day may come, when we say, 'I do' that
what God put together, from 2 halves into 1, no man
will put asunder...
To my love, my other half

That would have to be for my parents. Their commitment to both family and their marriage and keeping it has meant that I grew up in a wonderful household, religious and upright. They have shown me what it is I should aim to be and more so have made me want to promote a good image of them to the rest of the world, because really they have defined parts of my life growing up.

23/02/2018, 18:15 - TJ Musiitwa: So in this case what is someone supposed to do...  with girls how do you win?
23/02/2018, 18:16 - TJ Musiitwa: I say if you want to win...it is all in the ability to make her want it and see a scenarios where she did not get it...then I think one just might win
23/02/2018, 18:19 - Liz: Well gerls  like things they can show off
23/02/2018, 18:21 - Liz: It depends.. U myt give ha wat she doesn't like nd she will talk about it the whole of her life with the gerls
23/02/2018, 18:22 - Liz: Nd if its not good they will laugh at Ur life

01/03/2018, 10:04 - TJ Musiitwa: Planning for Lucy's birthday??
01/03/2018, 11:55 - TJ Musiitwa: Ingredients 
    1 cup flour
    2 Tbsp. sugar
    1 Tbsp. Magic Baking Powder
    1/2 tsp. salt
    1 egg
    1 cup milk
    2 Tbsp. oil


Steps
    Mix first 4 ingredients.
    Beat egg, milk and oil in medium bowl with whisk until blended. Stir in flour mixture.
    Ladle batter onto hot griddle or into hot skillet sprayed with cooking spray, using 1/4 cup batter for each pancake.    Cook on medium heat until bubbles begin to form on tops, then turn to brown other sides.
01/03/2018, 11:55 - TJ Musiitwa: Easy made pancakes
01/03/2018, 13:43 - Liz: Noo
01/03/2018, 13:44 - Liz: Sm other friend ts on Saturday.. I'm supposed to order today.. O tumoro
01/03/2018, 13:44 - Liz: 100k
01/03/2018, 13:47 - TJ Musiitwa: So you are in charge  of cake
01/03/2018, 13:47 - TJ Musiitwa: 100k for a regular sized cake right
01/03/2018, 13:48 - Liz: Thank you
01/03/2018, 13:48 - TJ Musiitwa: eat away😋
01/03/2018, 13:48 - Liz: Yeah..
01/03/2018, 13:49 - Liz: Most preferably rectangular
01/03/2018, 13:51 - TJ Musiitwa: So is CafeJavas an option??
01/03/2018, 13:51 - TJ Musiitwa: yeah rectangular but regular size or larger size ish
01/03/2018, 13:57 - TJ Musiitwa: Okay I really don't know the proper difference between a 1.5 kg and 2.5kg cake but from what I have read either size can fit around 12-16 people
01/03/2018, 13:58 - TJ Musiitwa: Also another issue is that most cake people need like a 24 hour pre-order for cakes so unless you are just going to walk in and buy one which is what I think is best so yeah
01/03/2018, 13:59 - TJ Musiitwa: Any way most of the cafe javas *1.5kg* cakes go for between *73k-80k*
01/03/2018, 14:02 - TJ Musiitwa: I have seen another place called Malimbus Cakes makes 2kg cakes at 100k any flavour based in Mutungo around Bugolobi so yeah that might be abit far
01/03/2018, 16:27 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha well doesn't seem to be me

09/03/2018, 16:03 - TJ Musiitwa: After 10 years, the wife starts to think their kid looks strange so she decides to do a DNA test.
She finds out that the kid is actually from completely different parents.
Wife: Honey, I have something very serious to tell you.
Husband: What’s up?
Wife: According to DNA test results, this is not our kid
Husband: Well you don’t remember, do you??
When we were leaving the hospital, we noticed that our baby had pissed and spoiled his underwear.
Then you said:
- "Please go change the baby, I’ll wait for you here."
So I went inside, got a clean one and left the dirty one there.
*Moral: Never give a man a job that doesn't belong to him. 😂

12/03/2018, 06:28 - TJ Musiitwa: Well to just put it....I was just explaining why maybe we weren't able to talk was cause of differing time schedules not all that aligned as well as the fact that the time you called I was still eating.
Also I was feeling like talking to you yesterday then when that did not happen...I just lost psych....
So I was using the voice note hoping that it could at least make up for not being able to talk last week and that hoping that we are able to find time sometime this week to actually talk.

I just closed off by saying...hope that you are better going into the new week, i miss you....which was why I wanted to get to hear your voice....hoping it would lift me up a bit....I needed it...
Love you and goodnight
12/03/2018, 06:28 - TJ Musiitwa: So that was that

25/03/2018, 19:16 - TJ Musiitwa: I have seen you smile before
25/03/2018, 19:17 - TJ Musiitwa: The way your smile captures the dimple and accentuates the curves of your face
25/03/2018, 19:17 - Liz: 😹😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅 oh my God Jonathan

25/03/2018, 19:20 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha well I read novels...
25/03/2018, 19:21 - TJ Musiitwa: Also to be honest...I read some article that was talking about how ladies don't want to over hear the same thing again and again about how beautiful they look...
25/03/2018, 19:22 - TJ Musiitwa: And that one should find something unique to compliment her on
25/03/2018, 19:23 - TJ Musiitwa: So instead of looking at just how beautiful her face is go into detail about how say her smile leading up to her dimple makes the face prettier
25/03/2018, 19:23 - TJ Musiitwa: _That's the one I just used on you_
25/03/2018, 19:24 - TJ Musiitwa: Or how..... _Am saving this one for later_😏
25/03/2018, 19:24 - Liz: 😍😍🙈🙈🙈🙈 awwww
25/03/2018, 19:24 - TJ Musiitwa: But basically it summaries as taking an everyday thing and make it even more special
25/03/2018, 19:26 - TJ Musiitwa: Anyone can say u r beautiful... literally anyone.
But it takes a special kind of person to see beyond just that beauty and not only _look_ but *see* what entails of that beauty
25/03/2018, 19:28 - Liz: So this is how u be all romantic like sm1 from my telenovelas

26/03/2018, 20:42 - TJ Musiitwa: I don't know had it been with like say fellow Ugandans no problem but these are Africans sure but meh!!
26/03/2018, 20:43 - TJ Musiitwa: Well I will grow to get used to it but I am not sure
26/03/2018, 20:44 - TJ Musiitwa: Let me just go and check it out probably tomorrow as long as it is big enough to fit me and all my needs then I just might try to make a push for it
26/03/2018, 20:45 - TJ Musiitwa: Rolex is the lifeblood of Ugandan street food that also made its way to international headlines
26/03/2018, 20:47 - TJ Musiitwa: https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/african-food-internet/index.html

26/03/2018, 20:56 - Liz: I'm sure he only needs good reasons for u to go to a private accommodation
26/03/2018, 20:59 - Liz: So these are just Africans..Are u sure u myt like it with them o they myt just irritate u..
26/03/2018, 21:00 - Liz: Yeap u should..  And isn't it till like October only..
26/03/2018, 21:00 - Liz: 🤔 not good a reason for u to eat it

04/04/2018, 21:04 - TJ Musiitwa: Tell me more
04/04/2018, 21:05 - Liz: Mhhh...
04/04/2018, 21:07 - TJ Musiitwa: 👀
04/04/2018, 21:09 - Liz: Men complain that women hv artificials.. Starting with
04/04/2018, 21:10 - Liz: Hair.. Nails.. Breasts.. Ass and all..
04/04/2018, 21:12 - Liz: But seriously they also don't see the natural things.. Instead they judge women..over lookin the fact that they also don't see the natural things
04/04/2018, 21:13 - Liz: Like seriously wat do they wat
04/04/2018, 21:13 - Liz: They don't want natural or artificial..🤷🏽‍♀
04/04/2018, 21:15 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha yes the perceptions of men....but you could say that it hasn't stemmed only from men but also from other women too who have gone ahead and made themselves look fuller than they are naturally and this has in turn affected the ways of how the world is like today
04/04/2018, 21:16 - TJ Musiitwa: But I get where you are coming from
04/04/2018, 21:16 - TJ Musiitwa: Men are undecisive of what they want.   However you should consider that not all men are the same
04/04/2018, 21:16 - Liz: Ohhh.. Not forgetting.. If u HV natural and its beyond.. They b like that too much💁🏾‍♂
04/04/2018, 21:17 - TJ Musiitwa: They are some who like artificial and there are those(such as myself )who will wholly appreciate natural
04/04/2018, 21:18 - TJ Musiitwa: It is a perspective view that differs
04/04/2018, 21:18 - TJ Musiitwa: But it can also depend on how one applies the artificial bit..
04/04/2018, 21:19 - TJ Musiitwa: I mean hey if you have a wig to make you look and feel good that is okay...crazy long nails naah not me.... pumping breasts and ass...naah I don't see it...
04/04/2018, 21:20 - TJ Musiitwa: But a woman is in control of her own body and how she chooses to present herself to the world...be it artificial semi-natural or natural...will always raise the conversation either way
04/04/2018, 21:21 - TJ Musiitwa: It is just best to have our views and we move on from that....
04/04/2018, 21:21 - TJ Musiitwa: But again...I see where you are coming from and I can understand your point of view
04/04/2018, 21:24 - Liz: But thea only a few pipo who will understand.. Others are all judgemental and stuff
04/04/2018, 21:27 - Liz: Thank you.. I'm a concerned citizen... I think men should just go with wat they HV...but they CNT.🤦🏾‍♀
04/04/2018, 21:29 - TJ Musiitwa: As long as that same advice reiterates to women as well
04/04/2018, 21:29 - Liz: 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽..
04/04/2018, 21:30 - Liz: Atee now how..
04/04/2018, 21:31 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha well we could start with why go to FACO?
04/04/2018, 21:32 - Liz: I think they go because *men* always critize them
04/04/2018, 21:32 - Liz: 🤷🏽‍♀
04/04/2018, 21:32 - TJ Musiitwa: And also how often have you heard that a girl likes how she looks like and doesn't try in one way or another to change it one way or another
04/04/2018, 21:34 - Liz: Maybe a few times.. But its still about *men*
04/04/2018, 21:38 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha okay
04/04/2018, 21:40 - Liz: Thank you for ur views lemme weight for other men..
04/04/2018, 21:41 - TJ Musiitwa: You're welcome... happy to do this anytime
04/04/2018, 21:41 - Liz: I myt become feminist🤧
04/04/2018, 21:42 - TJ Musiitwa: Hopefully the subtle type of feminist not those who go above and beyond to discredit everything and anything that guys say think or do....
04/04/2018, 21:42 - TJ Musiitwa: I mean sometimes if I'm being honest those types of feminists are abit toooo much
04/04/2018, 21:42 - TJ Musiitwa: And I actually have someone I know that is like that
04/04/2018, 21:43 - Liz: I have a friend like that...
04/04/2018, 21:43 - TJ Musiitwa: I understand she is standing up for a cause she believes in but to be extremist about it... sometimes just makes your cause almost lose weight
04/04/2018, 21:44 - Liz: 😂😂😂 hoooo.. I think everyone has a friend like that
04/04/2018, 21:46 - Liz: ahahahahaha... U just ignore.  Feminists can stand up for all they blv in trust me
04/04/2018, 21:46 - Liz: Is she Ur friend
04/04/2018, 21:47 - TJ Musiitwa: Used to be now haven't talked to her in like about 2 years so I just left it at that
04/04/2018, 21:47 - Liz: Nahh.. I blv in guys but I jst don't understand y they do some things
04/04/2018, 21:48 - Liz: Ohhh..eeehhh she must hv forgotten about u
04/04/2018, 21:48 - TJ Musiitwa: I too can support the feminist cause.... equal pay... equal rights better job opportunities and all that but I won't go and be crazy about it
04/04/2018, 21:50 - TJ Musiitwa: Same way those Arabs that say they are fighting to bring pain and suffering to the rest of the world in suicide bombers and all that are just extremists not jihadists
04/04/2018, 21:51 - TJ Musiitwa: Or I just forgot about her and i left it at that... that's why when she said she was changing numbers I did not bother asking for her new one...
04/04/2018, 21:52 - TJ Musiitwa: You get older and you get the circle of friends that you need not that you want
04/04/2018, 21:55 - Liz: Ohh I heard that some blv in that stuff because the more pipo u kill the more blessings in Janah🤷🏽‍♀
04/04/2018, 21:56 - Liz: 😂😂😂😂😂.
Ehhh u should Hia urself in my head
04/04/2018, 21:56 - Liz: 😂😂😂
04/04/2018, 21:58 - TJ Musiitwa: Exactly but is that really how Allah wants them to be. I will not claim to be a Muslim scholar but I guess from the general understanding of the omnipotent being that seeing killing doesn't honour His works
04/04/2018, 21:58 - TJ Musiitwa: Or teachings
04/04/2018, 21:59 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha 🤷🏾‍♂

10/04/2018, 19:08 - Liz: HOW TO TREAT YOUR WIFE

  Don’t shout at your
       wife when you are
       talking. It really 
       hurts her. 
       Proverbs 15:1

  Do not speak evil 
       of her to anyone. 
       Your wife will become
       who you call her. 
      Gen. 2:19

  Do not share her love
      or affection with another
      woman.
      It is called Adultery.
      Matt. 5:28

  Never compare your
       wife to another woman.
       If the other woman was
       good for you, God would
       have given her to you.
      2 Cor. 10:12

  Be gentle and 
       accommodating. She
       has sacrificed so much
       to be with you. 
       It hurts her deeply
       when you are hash
       and irritating. 
       Be tender.
       Eph. 4:2

  Hide nothing from her.
       You are now one and
       she’s your helpmate.
       Let there be no secret
       you are keeping 
       from her.
       Gen. 2:25

  Do not make negative
       comment about her
       body. She risked her
       life and beauty to carry
       your babies. She is a
       living soul not just
       flesh and blood. 
       Proverbs 18:22

  Do not let her body
       determine her worth.
       Cherish and appreciate
       her even till old age.
       Eph. 5:29

  Never shout at her
       in the public and in
       private. If you have
       an issue to sort with
       her, do it in the privacy
       of your room.
       Matt. 1:19

  Thank and appreciate
       her for taking good
       care of you, the kids
       and the house. It is
       a great sacrifice she
       is making.
       1 Thesso. 5:18

  All women cannot
       cook the same way;
       appreciate your 
       wife’s food.
       It is not easy to cook
       three meals a day,
       365 days a year 
       for several years.
       Pro. 31:14

  Never place your 
       siblings before her.
       She is your wife. 
       She is one with you.
       She must come 
       before your family.
       Gen. 2:24

  Invest seriously in
       her spiritual growth. 
       Buy books, tapes and
       any material that will
       edify her & strengthen
       her walk with God. 
       That’s the best thing
       you can do for her.
       Eph. 5:26

  Spend time with her
       to do Bible study 
       and pray.
       James 5:16

  Make time to play
       with her and enjoy
       her company.
       Remember when you
       are dead, she’s gonna
       be by your grave but
       your friends may be
       too busy to attend
       your funeral. 
       Ecc. 9:9

  Never use money
       to manipulate or 
       control her. All your
       money belongs to
       her. She is a joint heir
       with you of the 
       grace of God.
       1 Pet. 3:7

  Do not expose her
       weakness. You will be
       exposing yourself too.
       Be a shield around her.
       Eph. 5:30

  Honour her parents
       and be kind to her
       siblings.
       SOS. 8:2

  Never cease to tell
       her how much you
       love her all the days
       of her life. Women
       are never tired of
       hearing that.
       Eph. 5:25

  Grow to be like Jesus.
       That’s the only way
       you can be a good
       and godly husband.
      Rom. 8:29

     SAVE A HOME TODAY, 
              PASS IT ON 
TO ALL MEN PLEASE

LIKEWISE TO ALL WOMEN.

17/04/2018, 16:20 - TJ Musiitwa: Not that I know of why because you think that the ink may toxicate the blood I doubt
17/04/2018, 16:20 - TJ Musiitwa: I am sure people with tattoos can donate blood
17/04/2018, 16:21 - TJ Musiitwa: But I guess it should depend on the size of the tattoos or even how fresh a tattoo might be
17/04/2018, 16:22 - TJ Musiitwa: I don't think a person with full arms and length could donate blood but I think they could if say the  tatts have been around for a while like say over 3 months...I guess
17/04/2018, 16:22 - TJ Musiitwa: Just what I think
17/04/2018, 16:22 - TJ Musiitwa: Why the curious question?
17/04/2018, 16:23 - Liz: Hihi...I got a tattoo
17/04/2018, 16:24 - TJ Musiitwa: Okay just looked it up and yes they can...given that it was done with a sterile needle in a clean environment.... otherwise gotta wait like up to 12 months....(but I think that's a US thing)

18/04/2018, 21:43 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha well it won't be bad
18/04/2018, 21:44 - TJ Musiitwa: After all there are teeth models so what's with the face then
18/04/2018, 21:45 - Liz: Teeth😳
18/04/2018, 21:45 - TJ Musiitwa: However tell Doris to be a bit easy on the make up.... particularly around the mascara... don't know if it was just me who saw that in Lucy's picture...but well yeah....
Also am not tell Doris how to do her makeup am certain she is experienced in her field....
It's just my opinion
18/04/2018, 21:46 - TJ Musiitwa: Don't you see those who model for toothpaste commercials and all....or those billboards that you might see with the white teeth smile....what do you think they do?😄
18/04/2018, 21:47 - Liz: I'll tell ha as if my opinion..
18/04/2018, 21:48 - Liz: Lemme go check.. But is it to much
18/04/2018, 21:49 - Liz: 🙆🏽🙆🏽🙆🏽🙆🏽 I never thought they were models... I thought they were just thea
18/04/2018, 21:49 - Liz: Like just put thes
18/04/2018, 21:49 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha well not really maybe it was the lighting conditions that gave it more _pazaz_
18/04/2018, 21:49 - Liz: A
18/04/2018, 21:49 - TJ Musiitwa: Well that is a theory🤷🏾‍♂
18/04/2018, 21:50 - TJ Musiitwa: She looks good and all overall really
18/04/2018, 21:50 - Liz: 😷😊😊😊 I hope so... I'll first plait my hair and do other things then tell ha
18/04/2018, 21:50 - TJ Musiitwa: Maybe it is just me paying attention to some small details that don't quite contrast well with the whole look
18/04/2018, 21:51 - TJ Musiitwa: But heck as I said what do I know about make up
18/04/2018, 21:51 - TJ Musiitwa: Which is why I told Lucy....it is great being a guy
18/04/2018, 21:51 - TJ Musiitwa: I mean other than all the pros that come with being of the masculine gender....
18/04/2018, 21:52 - TJ Musiitwa: I don't have to fret about make up  and that to me is a relief
18/04/2018, 21:53 - Liz: Not exactly but I think so too...
18/04/2018, 21:53 - Liz: Mascara was too much
18/04/2018, 21:53 - TJ Musiitwa: Particularly that light outline around the eyebrows....(nahh)
18/04/2018, 21:54 - TJ Musiitwa: But the choice of colour tone for the foundation was well decided
18/04/2018, 21:56 - Liz: That's the reason I don't put mascara its just idk
18/04/2018, 21:57 - TJ Musiitwa: Well if you do it well it can work after all mascara is meant to bring the "pop" to your eyes...gives them that highlight that focuses attention to the eyes
18/04/2018, 21:57 - Liz: Actually do guys fret about anything...
18/04/2018, 21:58 - TJ Musiitwa: Yes like what to eat or whether these jeans are clean or not 😅😄
18/04/2018, 21:59 - Liz: As if a make up artist
18/04/2018, 21:59 - Liz: Okay I'll also ask u to apply my mascara
18/04/2018, 22:00 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha
18/04/2018, 22:00 - TJ Musiitwa: Can't believe we are talking about make up but hey that's what you get when you have a boyfriend such as myself
18/04/2018, 22:00 - Liz: 🤔🤔 u can eat anything.. Maybe clothes.. But guys jeans can be rebounded
18/04/2018, 22:01 - TJ Musiitwa: We can go on and on about make up and fashion and it will me not as great as talking with one of your girls but it would still be something
18/04/2018, 22:02 - TJ Musiitwa: Exactly so we still fret...but the question is how many times too many is rebounding jeans....
You mean to tell me you don't or can't rebound your jeans
I mean except the white ones those ones would need a miracle
18/04/2018, 22:02 - TJ Musiitwa: Also can I just say how do girls in Uganda keep white jeans white
18/04/2018, 22:03 - TJ Musiitwa: I mean Kampala yaafe is dusty _enfufu-inculous_

18/04/2018, 22:07 - TJ Musiitwa: Anti kale
18/04/2018, 22:08 - TJ Musiitwa: If it was me... white jeans only when I am traveling in a car not taxi or walking in Kampala because I honestly can't handle that scrubbing ehh
18/04/2018, 22:08 - Liz: Gwe white jeans I think I would treat them like my baby

I entered the one written groom relatives and found two more doors
*1 . ladies*
*2. men*
I went through the one for men only to find two more doors
*1 . people with gifts*
*2. people without gift*
I went through the one written people without gifts and found myself outside the hotel through the back door at the door it was written

03/05/2018, 22:22 - TJ Musiitwa: *A drunkard woke up one morning deeply repentant after a bitter fight with his wife the previous night. He noticed with dismay the crate of beer bottles that had caused the fight. He took it outside and started smashing the empty bottles one by one onto the wall. He smashed the first bottle swearing... "You are the reason I fight with my wife!" He smashed the second bottle... "You are the reason I don't love my children!" He smashed the third bottle.... "You are the reason I don't have a decent job!"... When he took the fourth bottle, he realized that the bottle was still sealed, full and cold. He hesitated for a moment and said... "You stand aside, I know you were not involved!"*

06/05/2018, 16:31 - TJ Musiitwa: Domestic violence is violence and  has never been love
06/05/2018, 16:31 - TJ Musiitwa: Under what basis could one even come to state that domestic violence is love?
06/05/2018, 16:35 - Liz: Well some guy said domestic violence is another form of love and I'm really .... Beating up a woman and all sorts of things is love

06/05/2018, 16:39 - TJ Musiitwa: Exactly why I say I don't see that as being love....
06/05/2018, 16:40 - TJ Musiitwa: Even child battering is not love however caining a child,as evidenced by the word in the Bible says that by caining your child you are extending love to them

06/05/2018, 16:57 - TJ Musiitwa: So you think that she could be blackmailing the lecturer or that the picture was accidentally leaked?
06/05/2018, 17:43 - Liz: Sources blv its black mail

19/05/2018, 20:35 - Liz: U know wat they call public display of affection... ?

19/05/2018, 20:36 - Liz: sorry I was talking to Tillie on fon
19/05/2018, 20:36 - TJ Musiitwa: Or are you implying this in context of how the bride and groom were like
19/05/2018, 20:37 - Liz: Yeap..more like this
19/05/2018, 20:37 - Liz: Gene everywhere in Uganda on t.v.. Its the wedding repeat and pipoz views
19/05/2018, 20:38 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha ....
19/05/2018, 20:38 - TJ Musiitwa: I didn't bother seeing it
19/05/2018, 20:38 - Liz: I heard the queen was against it at first btw
19/05/2018, 20:39 - Liz: I hadn't till everyone was all over it
19/05/2018, 20:39 - TJ Musiitwa: Well she is the Queen she has got overall say in what the royals gotta do
19/05/2018, 20:40 - TJ Musiitwa: And over 90 years...she has been around so for sure her word matters
19/05/2018, 20:41 - Liz: She was being racist jst
19/05/2018, 20:42 - TJ Musiitwa: Hahaha but she eventually got over it...
19/05/2018, 21:05 - Liz: I hope so...
19/05/2018, 21:18 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha but anyway... what's done is done... Megan is part of the royal family but not all that way
19/05/2018, 21:18 - TJ Musiitwa: While she might only get the title Duchess of Sussex
19/05/2018, 21:19 - TJ Musiitwa: She isn't referred to as her highness... only the husband is regarded as his Highness
19/05/2018, 21:19 - Liz: And she's resigned from being actress
19/05/2018, 21:19 - Liz: 😪
19/05/2018, 21:19 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah
19/05/2018, 21:19 - TJ Musiitwa: Going royal is all nice and all but it means giving up alot of things
19/05/2018, 21:19 - Liz: No lipstick bright colors😹.. I wouldn't survive
19/05/2018, 21:20 - TJ Musiitwa: Did I tell of a conversation i had with my dad where he was like if i was born into royalty would I like it
19/05/2018, 21:22 - TJ Musiitwa: Or rather if we were part of the first family i.e say I was the first son....
I wouldn't like it all the added complications with that...in school if you failed an exam what it would be like all that and more
19/05/2018, 21:22 - TJ Musiitwa: Naah I wouldn't handle it
19/05/2018, 21:23 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha only in it for the big princessy wedding and that's all
19/05/2018, 21:24 - TJ Musiitwa: Well that is what happens...raises the issue... marrying out of love... leaving what you do to join and become part of royalty
19/05/2018, 21:25 - TJ Musiitwa: It does beg the question choosing between the person you love and leaving behind the normal life and what you do or choosing what you do over the person who carries your heart, and continuing to live a normal life
19/05/2018, 21:26 - TJ Musiitwa: But is Lungujja a village?
19/05/2018, 21:27 - TJ Musiitwa: Goodnight dear
20/05/2018, 11:28 - Liz: Hey hun

20/05/2018, 11:29 - Liz: But yip I also wouldn't like it like really
20/05/2018, 11:31 - Liz: Its stressing....the media and stuff.. Eehhhh.. But on the brighter side one might HV a lot of opportunities

26/05/2018, 10:29 - Liz: MARRIED AND SINGLE MEN HEAR IT ALL.
I am a 30 years old lady who was once an international prostitute, i am well known in the copperbelt and lusaka bcz of this business. I want to talk about wat happens in the world of prostitutes/girlfriends.mostly in these homes women are usually told to pray for their marriages & pray for hubbies, but the same husbands are not praying for themselves for God to help them resist cheating. When you start cheating on your wife or fience you are in a bondage.I was in prostitution for 9 years, i had an evil tattoo on my waist such dat if i have sex with a man he,ll unknowingly make a covenant with me and he'll never leave me because he's now under the influence of the darkness. we used to use love potions on men to keep them, Most of these men dont willingly forget about their lovely wives or family or treat their beloved wives badly by choice , there is some thing supernatural that takes place. we used to make sure a man forgets about his wife completely, there are so many medicines that we used, some we can make and throw in a pit latrine toilet so that to a man the wife can smell like a toilet and looses all the interest in the wife. sometimes we wud make sure we know where a man stays and we then threw juju at the man's house around midnyt so dat no peace will b in dat house but just fights and squabbles every day. even now girls who want to get other pipo's husbands do what I'm talking about, they make sure they put love potions in food, drinking water, put juju in the man's bathing water more especially to those men who like bathing at the girlfriend's place, put juju inside vaginas so that a man goes crazy like a fool and will always think of sex with that same girl such that whatever a girl says or wants the man will do immediately.Pipo are wicked, yes prostitutes are beautiful, wen they smile as if you,v seen an angel, and they will do all the crazy moves during sex just to make a man more crazy but behind thoz smiles there is no good intentions apart from making your beautiful wife and children suffer.All what side chicks want is yo money and some want to just take over your wife's marriage so that they become in control of your wealth and later on kill you in some way and remain with your money and after that jump to another man.they dnt even love you, they hate you such dat they can even kill u if that is what is needed to be done in the case of just stealing yo money and go. There is nothing good in cheating, u may think ur a real man but in de actual sense ur just a foolish immoral man. We used to buy water which they used to bath a dead body and put drops in the water for drinking and give a man or used the same water to cook nshima so dat wen a man eats the nshima he can be as quite as a corpse such dat even if i said i want a car he can buy without refusing. Even now this thing is trending of using mortuary water and again there is this tree, the leaves of this same tree and the roots of a tree which someone hanged himself from and died, we get that and we mix and make a very powerful medicine such dat wen a man reaches home,he will over just useless stuff beat his wife to death. These medicines are being used even now by most girls who are desperate for men.May God forgive me because i have broken many marriages. sometimes the pillow case a man sleeps on wen he spends the night at the girlfriend's house the girlfriend takes it and makes a powerful black magic such dat the man's mind is tied and he will be thinking of the girlfriend always and won't be thinking straight. Sometimes we get small pieces of white cloth and after sex we clean a man taking off all the sperms from his manhood and from our vagina all in the name of whipping him clean but the same cloth is taken to ritual doctors for making powerful medicines, many girls have become next wives just by using this formula.men even buy expensive cars for their prostitutes/girlfriends because they are in a bondage such dat whatever they ask for they gave them. I applaud some men , u can try by all means to seduce them , they are "NO" nonsense type who are always guided by God and respect themselves and their wives. yes real faithful men are there and may God bless them. prostitutes/girlfriends outside marriage are evil, they can act all lovy dovy, but they are snakes they dnt love you at all , infact they hate you . All we needed or all they need is money from u that's all.The only woman who loves you in truth is your wife who you married in very natural ways and who always prays for you. Ladies and gentlemen this is my testimony, ladies pray for yo marriages not only wen things are bad but start now. The devil is roaming up and down looking for marriages to destroy everyday, also men pray for yourselves and start now. I thank God am born again and my aim now is to preach the word of God and tell the world my story to warn men on wat happens in the dark world of prostitutes/girlfriends. Remember what i have explained also is done on single men and in the end they just become womanizer and don't marry at all or they become impotent before marrying because their fertility is taken to the under world.SO ALL MEN WHETHER MARRIED OR SINGLE BE CAREFUL.

05/06/2018, 21:24 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha what do you think it means now?
05/06/2018, 21:27 - Liz: Depending on the situation.  Some pipo may be in shock
05/06/2018, 21:29 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha I just use it as response to something _shy-ly_ said or just as an option to this emoji 🙊
05/06/2018, 21:30 - Liz: But the eyes are closed😆 flying kisses makes more sense
05/06/2018, 21:48 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha
05/06/2018, 21:48 - TJ Musiitwa: We all make our own interpretations...
05/06/2018, 21:49 - TJ Musiitwa: But according to the emoji Unicode association....(searching now)
05/06/2018, 21:52 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha they call it, 'face with hand over mouth'
05/06/2018, 21:52 - Liz: Unha
05/06/2018, 21:52 - TJ Musiitwa: So essentially... whatever meaning someone attaches to it . ..
Shy to me... flying kisses to you..m
05/06/2018, 21:53 - Liz: Flying kisses is wrong
05/06/2018, 21:53 - TJ Musiitwa: 😘

05/06/2018, 21:55 - TJ Musiitwa: 🤭 this is like after you have shared something awkward with someone and it is basically... sly, shy or maybe naughty even😄😉
05/06/2018, 21:56 - Liz: 🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭 okay
05/06/2018, 21:57 - TJ Musiitwa: At least that's me.. essentially try to mirror the emoji with what your own real facial expression could be basing on context

07/06/2018, 11:31 - TJ Musiitwa: I have friends, then best friends...then inner best friends....
07/06/2018, 11:32 - Liz: 🤭🤭 inner best friends??? Wats that

07/06/2018, 11:36 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha they are the friends that despite what happens or how long we take to talk....we come back and it's like we never were separated.... conversation is always gonna be good with them and having them in the environment is a good mood....
Also they are open to sharing with me anything that they wish
07/06/2018, 11:37 - TJ Musiitwa: And so far I have like maybe 1/2/3 people in that circle
07/06/2018, 11:37 - Liz: <Media omitted>
07/06/2018, 11:38 - TJ Musiitwa: Because varying levels of how we  communicate....sort of determine...who is a best friend and a friend
07/06/2018, 11:38 - TJ Musiitwa: 😜😜😜😜😜😜😜
07/06/2018, 11:38 - TJ Musiitwa: Now I have to buy a similar flannel shirt so that we can be twinning😅😅
07/06/2018, 11:58 - TJ Musiitwa: *Your Wife Is Your Wife*
A married couple was walking through a garden, suddenly a dog ran towards them.
They both knew it will bite them...
The husband lifted his wife to let the dog bite him rather than his sweetheart.
The dog stopped before them, unsure what to do, barked a little and ran away.
The husband put his wife down, expecting a hug and a few kind words of gratitude from her.
But his wife shouted "I've seen people throwing stones & sticks at dogs, this is the first time I see someone trying to throw his wife at a dog"

Moral: A Wife is a Wife 

"No One ELSE Can MIS-UNDERSTAND a Husband Better, than a Wife."

Husband it is well. Take heart it is part of the challenges of being a husband.

HAPPY WORLDS HUSBAND DAY💁🏼‍♂...! 


WOOOOPPSSS🤥!

08/06/2018, 10:28 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha oh okay well in that case...if you are likely to be out and about for over 6 hours on your feet... surely carrying the extra set of shoes isn't a bad idea but if you can't then I say just go comfortable
08/06/2018, 10:28 - TJ Musiitwa: Better to be comfortable and not in pain than to be in pain and not comfortable

09/06/2018, 19:38 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha well those are good questions but ultimately you have to ask one
09/06/2018, 19:39 - TJ Musiitwa: But if you ask for the when you shall die....it sort of will put you on edge as you get closer and closer to that day and you might or might not live life relaxed as you would have if you didn't know
09/06/2018, 19:41 - TJ Musiitwa: I would more or less ask what is the cure to the illnesses that many suffer from especially all forms of cancer & AIDS?
09/06/2018, 19:41 - TJ Musiitwa: All that in one question to get the most out of that answer
09/06/2018, 19:44 - Liz: ☺☺☺ aww... Okay

11/06/2018, 17:23 - TJ Musiitwa: So how's your Monday been?
11/06/2018, 17:24 - Liz: 🤭🤭🤭 stop sleeping...
11/06/2018, 17:24 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha okay I was siesta-ring
11/06/2018, 17:25 - Liz: Its been quite okay...interesting classes.. New friend... Yea
11/06/2018, 17:25 - Liz: Hihi...okay stop siesta...ring
11/06/2018, 17:26 - TJ Musiitwa: Awesome
11/06/2018, 17:26 - TJ Musiitwa: Interesting classes... I guess I'll be getting more jazz like that when campus commences
11/06/2018, 17:28 - Liz: So we had this discussion that got me thinking... Wat do u expect Ur future wife to do🤔
11/06/2018, 17:28 - Liz: Just give me a sneak peak into it
11/06/2018, 17:31 - Liz: Hun... These classes are really 👌🏾.. First its a couple. Thing so we actually feel the love btn these two pipo that happen to mentor us....
11/06/2018, 17:31 - TJ Musiitwa: Oh so these are different classes or is this still leadership class?
11/06/2018, 17:34 - Liz: Its the same class but like they work as husband and wife... That's just them
11/06/2018, 17:38 - TJ Musiitwa: My future wife, well 1stly I would expect her to love herself and also love me too. I would expect her to be as work herself to success in her career but I would also like that she be ready to have fun once in a while.
I would expect my future wife to be a family person... ready to ride along with me the seas of family and parenting.
I will just end by saying that this is only a few of the stuff... but conclude and say as my wife, she will be my life partner and she'll already be smart enough to do all the she knows she has to do as part of her play to make the house a home
11/06/2018, 17:39 - TJ Musiitwa: Oh okay that's cool
11/06/2018, 17:42 - Liz: 🙃
11/06/2018, 17:43 - TJ Musiitwa: Well that must have been quite the topic...
Was there an also *what do you expect your future husband to do* question?
11/06/2018, 18:02 - Liz: No
11/06/2018, 18:04 - Liz: It was a heated discussion about future husbands... Some guy said.  Well shes supposed to lay my bed...
Then mbu I'll HV a problem if my future wife entered the house after him... Nd I was like *wattttttttttttt*
11/06/2018, 18:04 - Liz: I couldn't blv it
11/06/2018, 18:11 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha if he has a problem with the wife coming home after him so who does he expect will be home taking care of the children per se.... spirits?
11/06/2018, 18:14 - TJ Musiitwa: Now those things like make the bed and the dishes and all that would lie under the things that a wife would do as part of the work of making the house a home
11/06/2018, 18:14 - TJ Musiitwa: The husband is the bread winner and goes out to forage for utilities of the house
11/06/2018, 18:16 - TJ Musiitwa: The dynamics that make a family or a house have been there for time immemorial and have worked so in some way tried and true dynamic...while it can be adjusted should not always be tampered with
11/06/2018, 18:16 - TJ Musiitwa: Get my point
11/06/2018, 18:21 - Liz: 🤗🤗🤗
11/06/2018, 18:23 - TJ Musiitwa: This is where the #Ssenga talk comes in😜
11/06/2018, 18:23 - TJ Musiitwa: And from what you have shared with me in the past you have attended quite a few of them
11/06/2018, 18:23 - Liz: 🤔🤔🤔🤔 we shall see later🤗
11/06/2018, 18:25 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha ayt
11/06/2018, 18:25 - TJ Musiitwa: So any answers here?
11/06/2018, 18:26 - Liz: 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
11/06/2018, 18:28 - Liz: 🤐🤐 nop my opinions just disagree with everything.. So
11/06/2018, 18:29 - TJ Musiitwa: Just lay them out....not like anyone is planning to attack you
11/06/2018, 18:30 - Liz: Hmmm
11/06/2018, 18:30 - Liz: First wait even
11/06/2018, 19:15 - Liz: This is part of wat a normal wife should do but I think both pipo just agree.. If u can make the bed.. Make it.  If u can do the dishes do them just help anywhere not that the wife should do everything because shes supposed to.  I mean both of you work nd both contribute to the house utilities... Its just not fair to leave the wife to do everything because maybe culture teaches this or that... Ur in the marriage together u just HV to help each other
11/06/2018, 19:23 - Liz: I think that should be it.  And before home after u😳 huh...... Difference in jobs.. Maybe the wife is busy with something at work.. U know things just come up so u don't expect ha to always appear before u like really but well I think the man just adjusts.. If shes home fine if she's not just let it go... After all Ur in that r/ship together but also if she comes back before.. The wifely duties shouldnt b suppressed she helps Wea she can.. This is just my opinion... I don't think this should even be an issue...just a bed..u both sleep in it... Dishes everyone eats in.. 🤷🏾‍♀ Marriage shouldn't really change  pipos way of life... Just move along with it..
11/06/2018, 19:24 - Liz: 😆 I hope I'm not speaking like some already emancipated chic
11/06/2018, 21:14 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha you are not...
11/06/2018, 21:14 - TJ Musiitwa: You are speaking from the perspective of a modern woman
11/06/2018, 21:15 - TJ Musiitwa: Trust me I concur with you on the fact about the coming back home thing....I don't think it should be a thing in the marriage....
11/06/2018, 21:17 - TJ Musiitwa: Yes I would agree....with this a simple thing such as making the bed....does go a long way and if it  can show my future son/s what or how a marriage should be then I would know I was raising them right
11/06/2018, 21:19 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha all this marriage talk had me going through the marriage vows in my head then I remembered that video that was going around of some bride who was like, " _for richer and for richer_ " 🤣😅
11/06/2018, 21:19 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha what is this prison?
11/06/2018, 21:19 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha....
11/06/2018, 21:21 - Liz: Hihi... Thank you hun... I'm just seeing the small things that pipo ignore nd can possibly break thea r/ship without their notice... The thing is LOVE... The rest just fall into place..
11/06/2018, 21:22 - Liz: 🙂 hahaha... I thought
11/06/2018, 21:24 - Liz: So u agree make it if u can.. Not that Ur wife should make it always
11/06/2018, 21:25 - Liz: 😂😂😂😂 banae
11/06/2018, 21:25 - Liz: Almost....
11/06/2018, 21:28 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah of course....if I'm the last one out of bed...might as well....
Now this is where I will be getting the psych to leave bed early enough...😅😅
11/06/2018, 21:28 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha you recall it too
11/06/2018, 21:30 - Liz: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 now u see
11/06/2018, 21:30 - Liz: Both of us love sleeping so we myt both just get stuck to the bed..
11/06/2018, 21:31 - Liz: But I really don't mind doing any of those things...
11/06/2018, 21:31 - Liz: Yessss😅 no poverty
11/06/2018, 21:35 - TJ Musiitwa: Hehe but if there is something worth getting out of doing...I might as well take it...
11/06/2018, 21:35 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha
11/06/2018, 21:37 - Liz: 🙂🙂🙂 🙂👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 amen
11/06/2018, 21:37 - Liz: But this is too. Much bold
11/06/2018, 21:38 - TJ Musiitwa: Ey maybe she knew that both of them being power houses they were assured
11/06/2018, 22:34 - Liz: 😆 is she God?? Him he she???

17/06/2018, 21:40 - TJ Musiitwa: Dear Elizabeth,
My sweetheart, my love, my pineapple ☺️
Today marks the end of a chapter and the commencement of a new one. But as you go into the new age, we look back at the amazing things you have accomplished in the 18s you have had; completed high school, got great results, pass the law entry tests, been in a relationship with your boyfriend for 2 years (to mention of the few that I have come to know, am sure your friends who have been there with you know alot more) etc. It is through all these good things that you have come this far and accomplished so much. However, life isn't all roses and surely you have had some hard times and all but through them the experience you have gotten has made you smarter, more knowledgeable and ready to take on the world from a new perspective.
All that said and done, you need to look forward to the new age along which new experiences, new challenges, new friends a whole new empty chapter for your to write and make your stamp on in the world.
Even with all this remember that you have the backing from many people who love and support you...that close circle of people that would be ready to fight with you. Your family love you, your friends support you and your boyfriend believes in you and all that you can do (of course he loves you too....like alot alot😍)

We can of course not forget to thank the Lord God for granting us the gift of a special person such as yourself in our lives and may He reward you all through the days of your life.

Today on this wonderful day, I celebrate you. 
Happy Birthday to the girl that rocks my world.
Thank you for being my over and above constant reminder of the extraordinary, 
I love you Elizabeth
Happy 19th baby,
❤️ Jonathan

24/06/2018, 20:20 - TJ Musiitwa: So anything else you wish to add on about yesterday....all activities and what not
24/06/2018, 20:22 - Liz: 😅😅😅 eehhh lemme get the psyche.. I had chall those things
24/06/2018, 20:23 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha sawa sawa
24/06/2018, 20:25 - TJ Musiitwa: So I got ask from your perspective what do you do if you once had a friend that you used to talk to..then you stopped talking...then now they come back in your life...as if nothing happened...do you still go back to them....?
24/06/2018, 20:27 - Liz: Yea I would.
If we were good friends and nothing happened just no communication... I would talk to them
24/06/2018, 20:27 - TJ Musiitwa: I guess you and I just have ways to handle people
24/06/2018, 20:28 - TJ Musiitwa: I'll be honest this distance away from people I was friends with has just shown me that really with casual friends..it can determine the conversation and closeness one has...
24/06/2018, 20:29 - TJ Musiitwa: Or maintains
24/06/2018, 20:29 - TJ Musiitwa: Used to talk to lots of people now ...not so much
24/06/2018, 20:29 - TJ Musiitwa: I guess that is also cause as you grow up that circle of friends will reduce...so I guess I should be used to it...and really in a way I am
24/06/2018, 20:31 - TJ Musiitwa: Then again I am sort of an emotions kinda person....I hold grudges and tend to keep em...that could be the difference between you and I.
You are way better than me and too good to hold grudges against people.
24/06/2018, 20:33 - TJ Musiitwa: One thing someone does or doesn't do and it really does keep a mark about them in my book... why should the good people always be the ones that are discarded...(then again we all have our different definitions of what we can call good in people)
Just as we all have different meanings to what we call love
24/06/2018, 20:33 - TJ Musiitwa: I just don't know...
Help me out here... please
😔😟
24/06/2018, 20:36 - Liz: 🌚 u just???
24/06/2018, 20:37 - TJ Musiitwa: I just don't know ....I have these feelings or moods or something...
24/06/2018, 20:44 - Liz: I know those feelings.. And moods but then somehow u just learn to let it go... Talk. To those who talk to you and those who dont.  U move on but incase they come back u just confront them about that one thing get there explanations and move on..now this cannot apply to u..but u can just teach urself to let things go.. And be live with anything that comes.. You there will be those pipo that still hurt us and u just let them be.. Its just a sequence...
24/06/2018, 20:48 - TJ Musiitwa: That must be one thing that I know about myself...trying to let things go...
24/06/2018, 20:51 - TJ Musiitwa: It is possible but wow oh so hard...and true while the Bible lets us know that hatred/anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die, I guess trying to get to that instance of myself will be awfully hard and take a long time but hopefully I can get there....
24/06/2018, 20:52 - TJ Musiitwa: Thanks for listening to my once in the usual rants or moods, I am glad to know that I can have someone to talk to about these things about me...not the perfect human but hey at least these issues are what make me human ( among many other things).
24/06/2018, 20:52 - TJ Musiitwa: Thank you
24/06/2018, 20:54 - TJ Musiitwa: PS: You are welcome anytime to talk to me about your issues, highs and lows, got my 👂🏾👂🏾 for you🙂
24/06/2018, 21:03 - Liz: It takes a lot to let go off things but if u let go u actually notice other good things that keep happening to you... So just be positive u let those pipo go..if they decide to come back...I personally tend to tell pipo in a joking way..so its much easier sometimes though I also let things flow.. Yesterday I met many people I hadn't talked to since vac started but we just put that away... Smiled and moved on😊..its just life..people will do things to us but the best thing we can do to our self is letting go
24/06/2018, 21:05 - Liz: You will just start with a few things... Think about how much u love urself and want to be happy... Everything will start falling into place... Move with the wind😉
24/06/2018, 21:06 - Liz: Haha... No problem.. Anytime hun..anytime..

26/06/2018, 21:19 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha already....

26/06/2018, 21:19 - TJ Musiitwa: Damn ok ..
26/06/2018, 21:19 - Liz: Messi🤧
26/06/2018, 21:20 - Liz: Haha.   Its. Okay..
26/06/2018, 21:20 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha as people call him the Goat...I frankly don't give a damn

26/06/2018, 21:22 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah heard they are a very good team so maybe won't be all that easy for Argentina

26/06/2018, 21:23 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha tell em girlfriend
26/06/2018, 21:24 - Liz: Well they are and Argentines HV messi as saviour
26/06/2018, 21:24 - TJ Musiitwa: But also as their liability... because they know how good of a striker he is.. The defense will always be on him...
26/06/2018, 21:26 - TJ Musiitwa: So they might want to score and want the best chance to do so but if your best best man is in the sights of the entire defense then you gotta take a chance with the 2nd best and hope he gets the job done
26/06/2018, 21:27 - Liz: 😤 why is he too talented aahh aahh Africans should show him wassap
26/06/2018, 21:48 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha guess that's just how international football works

27/06/2018, 19:48 - Liz: Awwww.. Okay.

27/06/2018, 19:54 - Liz: I shal
27/06/2018, 19:54 - Liz: On the old  one
27/06/2018, 19:55 - TJ Musiitwa: Still have to transfer the contacts but I guess you have the whole of tomorrow to set it up just right
27/06/2018, 19:58 - Liz: 😄😄 wow  okay.
27/06/2018, 19:58 - Liz: Thanks hun
27/06/2018, 19:58 - Liz: I'm trying
27/06/2018, 20:06 - TJ Musiitwa: Well if you had saved your contacts with Google then all you have to do was just download an app called Contacts it's from Google, blue icon then as long as you are signed in the rest just happens automatically
27/06/2018, 20:06 - TJ Musiitwa: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.contacts
27/06/2018, 20:07 - Liz: 😭 I'm failing
27/06/2018, 20:08 - TJ Musiitwa: Or OK just go to your old phone, the contacts app, look for the settings and try and look for export contacts...
27/06/2018, 20:09 - TJ Musiitwa: I think such an option should be there....if not... maybe in the actual settings.
27/06/2018, 20:11 - Liz: Okay I will I haven't  cooked 🤭🤭🤭🤭
27/06/2018, 20:11 - Liz: Lemme first cook my mum didn't  cook Bambi 😂😂
27/06/2018, 20:11 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha ayaa OK you go do that....I don't know how long I will be able to stay awake though...
27/06/2018, 20:12 - TJ Musiitwa: But you do that, come back and maybe we can sort through this hustle of getting the contacts in your phone
27/06/2018, 20:12 - Liz: It's okay if u feel sleepy
27/06/2018, 20:13 - Liz: I'll take  really long
27/06/2018, 20:13 - TJ Musiitwa: Hmm well um ok
27/06/2018, 20:15 - TJ Musiitwa: I'll be up fur about 45 or so minutes... hopefully you can get the initial bit done we can get this done quickly
27/06/2018, 20:16 - Liz: Thank  you  love  u kisses
27/06/2018, 20:16 - Liz: Malaysian boyfriend  as pipo say
27/06/2018, 20:16 - Liz: The cake had TORIA at 19😂 eeehhh
27/06/2018, 20:16 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha I saw it....
27/06/2018, 20:17 - TJ Musiitwa: You're welcome.... I'll wait for you
27/06/2018, 21:10 - Liz: Haha...  Bambi
27/06/2018, 21:10 - Liz: I'm hia
27/06/2018, 21:10 - TJ Musiitwa: Okay so you got your old phone near by
27/06/2018, 21:11 - Liz: Yea
27/06/2018, 21:11 - TJ Musiitwa: 2 ways to go about this.
The easier version would depend on if you saved your contacts to your Google account.
Did you?
27/06/2018, 21:12 - Liz: 😄yeah some
27/06/2018, 21:12 - TJ Musiitwa: Some...so not all of them....
27/06/2018, 21:12 - Liz: But also my brother put his email  so I saved most thea
27/06/2018, 21:13 - TJ Musiitwa: Hmm but that would also house his contacts and I am guessing you might not want that....
27/06/2018, 21:13 - Liz: Nope his aren't hia
27/06/2018, 21:14 - TJ Musiitwa: But if so....then just simply tap the link I sent you... should open up the play store to the app that will simply get all the contacts you stored with the Google account
27/06/2018, 21:14 - TJ Musiitwa: Here
27/06/2018, 21:14 - Liz: But I don't  mind  having  his too
27/06/2018, 21:15 - TJ Musiitwa: Second option....this might involve a lot of typing....so voice message to the rescue
27/06/2018, 21:15 - Liz: Okay thanks
27/06/2018, 21:15 - TJ Musiitwa: <Media omitted>
27/06/2018, 21:20 - Liz: It's not working..
27/06/2018, 21:22 - TJ Musiitwa: Okay so 2nd option then
27/06/2018, 21:25 - Liz: Okay I'm trying
27/06/2018, 21:32 - Liz: I'm I supposed to connect  both the new n old fon  to import ND export
27/06/2018, 21:34 - TJ Musiitwa: Yes preferably.... both have to be connected
27/06/2018, 21:34 - TJ Musiitwa: Could be via Bluetooth or something
27/06/2018, 21:34 - TJ Musiitwa: Why have you seen the prompt it is something not showing up...
27/06/2018, 21:35 - TJ Musiitwa: Bluetooth doesn't use data so even if the old phone has no SIM card in it....the transfer should work
27/06/2018, 21:38 - TJ Musiitwa: So did you find the export contacts thing from the old phone?
27/06/2018, 21:38 - Liz: I have  but I hadn't  connected  the blue  tooth
27/06/2018, 21:38 - Liz: So I'm still trying
27/06/2018, 21:38 - TJ Musiitwa: Or if not you could optionally check on the new phone and look for import contacts....
27/06/2018, 21:39 - Liz: Yeah..  But it's export/import
27/06/2018, 21:39 - Liz: Okay sure
27/06/2018, 21:39 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah so it is the same thing and it should have the option to import contacts.....
27/06/2018, 21:40 - TJ Musiitwa: I think you can also be able to export the messages, if you want major Ratees birthday messages on the new phone as well😁
27/06/2018, 21:41 - Liz: 😭😭 those were cleared Thea no where I don't have any birthday  wishes
27/06/2018, 21:42 - TJ Musiitwa: Well from now onwards 🤞🏾 no more facing that problem
27/06/2018, 21:42 - TJ Musiitwa: 😁
27/06/2018, 21:42 - Liz: 😊😊😊 yes yea

27/06/2018, 21:51 - TJ Musiitwa: So doing it from the new one then
27/06/2018, 21:51 - TJ Musiitwa: Nothing...hmm🤔
27/06/2018, 21:52 - TJ Musiitwa: Ehh it can't be this hard to transfer contacts, now what could the issue be
27/06/2018, 21:54 - Liz: New fon. Yeah
27/06/2018, 21:55 - TJ Musiitwa: It should work🤞🏾
27/06/2018, 21:55 - Liz: 🌚 I've never  transferred contacts
27/06/2018, 21:56 - TJ Musiitwa: Hehe yup
27/06/2018, 21:57 - Liz: I'll just  find someone  to do it
27/06/2018, 21:57 - TJ Musiitwa: And when they show you how you will be surprised by just how easy it is.....
27/06/2018, 21:58 - TJ Musiitwa: They should not cheat you and be like pay me this much to do it.... it is quite easy they might just want to make money from you...
27/06/2018, 21:58 - TJ Musiitwa: So for now what will you do?
27/06/2018, 21:59 - TJ Musiitwa: Copy the important contacts you need physically probably
27/06/2018, 21:59 - Liz: Yeah.  All pipo I'll thank

30/06/2018, 20:32 - Liz: 6000 per month
30/06/2018, 20:33 - Liz: And it increases with time
30/06/2018, 20:33 - Liz: 🤷🏽‍♀
30/06/2018, 20:33 - TJ Musiitwa: How does it increase with time
30/06/2018, 20:33 - Liz: Its just too unfair for us🌚
30/06/2018, 20:35 - Liz: What if we all decide to pay the tax then the government turns on us in the future and we HV to pay like 400 or something... Like in the long run
30/06/2018, 20:35 - TJ Musiitwa: It's unfair to everyone
30/06/2018, 20:36 - TJ Musiitwa: There will obviously be a repeal sometime soon
30/06/2018, 20:36 - TJ Musiitwa: I hope it can happen
30/06/2018, 20:36 - Liz: U get me
30/06/2018, 20:36 - Liz: All Ugandans...all the foreigners in uganda
30/06/2018, 20:37 - TJ Musiitwa: I wonder what the process could be to repeal the tax bill....
30/06/2018, 20:37 - TJ Musiitwa: I hate politics but surely for one I would stand up to this cause
30/06/2018, 20:38 - Liz: So I remember...shuria called the whiteman a colonizer in black panther🤭🤭
30/06/2018, 20:38 - Liz: I know... I really really pray
30/06/2018, 20:40 - Liz: Ik
30/06/2018, 20:41 - Liz: I heard rumour that they 'll no longer sell airtime in shops 
Mbu strictly mobile money
30/06/2018, 20:41 - Liz: Yes for any transaction 1%
30/06/2018, 20:41 - Liz: Yet paying the tax is also thru mobile money? So they'll tax the tax?
30/06/2018, 20:43 - TJ Musiitwa: Oh no that rumor is actually true...they want to get rid of scratch cards
30/06/2018, 20:43 - TJ Musiitwa: I seriously don't like the direction Uganda is going rather the government is going...
30/06/2018, 20:44 - TJ Musiitwa: I have a friend here from Uganda whom when I told him.about the whole taxing airtime thing....
30/06/2018, 20:45 - TJ Musiitwa: He was like ok that's it...
"I'm staying here and marrying Siti"
30/06/2018, 20:45 - TJ Musiitwa: Frankly this whole joke of a thing is more or less not really giving me vibes for wanting to be in Uganda...
30/06/2018, 20:45 - Liz: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 lemme laugh before I'm taxed for laughing
30/06/2018, 20:46 - TJ Musiitwa: I have family and friends and people I care about and *you* there but really
30/06/2018, 20:47 - TJ Musiitwa: The better of 2 devils would have been to add the tax cost to airtime...so that they take off the amount from airtime and not separate tax but they have to go out and make life hard for people
30/06/2018, 20:47 - TJ Musiitwa: 🤦🏾‍♂
30/06/2018, 20:48 - TJ Musiitwa: 😡I am getting even more pissed
30/06/2018, 20:48 - Liz: Eeehhhh okay stop now

30/06/2018, 20:52 - TJ Musiitwa: But how does the country develop if you put up road blocks that are not adding any value

01/07/2018, 15:56 - Liz: I will use the Bluetooth I promise
01/07/2018, 15:56 - Liz: I was seeing Tilly
01/07/2018, 15:57 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha well it's not for me to force you...you just do what you feel is comfortable enough for you
01/07/2018, 15:57 - Liz: Then some friend asked to take me for birthday lunch since she didn't do anything for me🌚
01/07/2018, 15:57 - TJ Musiitwa: Awesome
01/07/2018, 15:57 - TJ Musiitwa: Did she have anything to tell me... sometimes she does....

01/07/2018, 16:02 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha... she's becoming a high school teenager....
01/07/2018, 16:02 - TJ Musiitwa: Hope she is enjoying form 1
01/07/2018, 16:03 - Liz: Yeah.. She didn't complain so. I think she's still okay
01/07/2018, 16:03 - TJ Musiitwa: Good for her
01/07/2018, 16:05 - Liz: Yip
01/07/2018, 18:37 - Liz: So I here there blocking VPN🌚
01/07/2018, 18:37 - Liz: 😤
01/07/2018, 18:37 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah well it was expected
01/07/2018, 18:37 - TJ Musiitwa: Given that it is a way to circumvent the tax paying...
01/07/2018, 18:38 - TJ Musiitwa: So of course they are likely to block it
01/07/2018, 18:39 - Liz: So I need to officially ask my brother how he changed his phone to face another country😪
01/07/2018, 18:40 - Liz: 😕😕 as in how do they even think of blocking VPN🙄🙄  isnt it created to help people like us
01/07/2018, 18:41 - TJ Musiitwa: I think most of them have been doing a factory reset and changing stuff here and there...
01/07/2018, 18:41 - TJ Musiitwa: But that then ends up causing a few complications....reinstalling applications alot....so only do it if you have nothing to lose
01/07/2018, 18:42 - TJ Musiitwa: It is yes....even people in China do the same but well if a government is planning on blocking VPNs well who knows...
01/07/2018, 18:43 - TJ Musiitwa: I'll have to look up how they are going to do that though considering that to block the use of a VPN they have to block many IP addresses...hmmm🤔
01/07/2018, 18:44 - Liz: If it does I don't think I'm paying that tax.. I HV nothing that can pay it.... Like honestly... This is just government nonsense
01/07/2018, 18:45 - Liz: He said he changed his Os
01/07/2018, 18:45 - Liz: To kenya🤷🏽‍♀
01/07/2018, 18:46 - TJ Musiitwa: His what...ohh I guess he changed his IP...
01/07/2018, 18:46 - Liz: Some man at the supermarket said his is blocked so idk...
01/07/2018, 18:47 - TJ Musiitwa: I think I know what he did... just changing the IP address can then the traffic is routed via a different DNS
01/07/2018, 18:48 - Liz: 😹😹😹 I'm officially lost
01/07/2018, 18:48 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha yes very technical
01/07/2018, 18:49 - TJ Musiitwa: Just ask him if he changed his DNS address...if he says yes that's what he did then yup I guess I'll be sure
01/07/2018, 18:49 - Liz: Okay sure
01/07/2018, 18:50 - Liz: So this is how I'll be getting lost wen we get married
01/07/2018, 18:51 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha probably... but you will just have to leave it up to me to ensure you get the best settings and setups via your electronic devices
01/07/2018, 18:51 - TJ Musiitwa: I'll even be sure to teach you a few things....so that you know how to....
01/07/2018, 18:53 - Liz: 💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽 yesszssz
01/07/2018, 18:53 - Liz: Finally I'm smiling against this ugly tax
01/07/2018, 18:53 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha good
01/07/2018, 18:56 - Liz: He didn't change the dns
01/07/2018, 18:56 - TJ Musiitwa: So what did he do?
01/07/2018, 18:56 - Liz: Hehehe.... I won't teach u anything
01/07/2018, 18:57 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha you will...
01/07/2018, 18:57 - Liz: Lemme show u
01/07/2018, 18:58 - TJ Musiitwa: How to do plaiting...I still don't know how to do that ...
I am trying to think of what else...
Probably my cooking could use _some_ help
01/07/2018, 18:58 - Liz: changed my device location, thats it. Its pointed in a different country
01/07/2018, 18:58 - Liz: Its as if I'm in Kenya now so the Uganda airspace doesn't apply to me
01/07/2018, 18:58 - Liz: I use a different OS hehe
01/07/2018, 18:58 - Liz: Windows. Idk for Android
01/07/2018, 18:58 - Liz: No your Operating system [OS]is Android. different from mine
01/07/2018, 18:58 - Liz: Plaiting😳
01/07/2018, 18:58 - TJ Musiitwa: Hmm really wow ok....so from settings or...
01/07/2018, 18:59 - TJ Musiitwa: You know that you are also using android.... right
01/07/2018, 18:59 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah hair plaiting...I don't know that
01/07/2018, 18:59 - Liz: I guess
01/07/2018, 19:00 - Liz: His using windows
01/07/2018, 19:00 - Liz: 🤣 I also don't know.very well.. But I can do something
01/07/2018, 19:01 - TJ Musiitwa: Oh these are his messages...I was wondering what was going on...like huh...🤔🤷🏾‍♂
01/07/2018, 19:02 - Liz: Ooohhh sorry sorry..hun😊
01/07/2018, 19:03 - TJ Musiitwa: He is a Windows user....
01/07/2018, 19:03 - TJ Musiitwa: But I guess maybe changing a DNS could help...I think not entirely sure...but maybe
01/07/2018, 19:07 - Liz: Yea
01/07/2018, 19:09 - Liz: One is blocked...😪😪😪😪
01/07/2018, 19:09 - TJ Musiitwa: So the other is almost gone as well
01/07/2018, 19:09 - Liz: And all my apps???
01/07/2018, 19:09 - Liz: I hope not
01/07/2018, 19:10 - TJ Musiitwa: No I don't think the DNS thing will work...
01/07/2018, 19:11 - Liz: 😳😳😳😳
01/07/2018, 19:13 - TJ Musiitwa: The fact is that your connection is being ridden on from the SIM card and the service providers network
01/07/2018, 19:14 - TJ Musiitwa: Ultimately it just has to come down to it, you might probably just want to pay depending on how needy you are in terms of your social media...
01/07/2018, 19:14 - TJ Musiitwa: You can do the weekly payment instead of the monthly one
01/07/2018, 19:15 - TJ Musiitwa: That's until well possibly the possibility of the bill to block the tax passes
01/07/2018, 19:18 - Liz: I CNT pay... Like I don't HV the mobile money thing on my simcard even if I was willing to pay...and there is no paying without mobile money
01/07/2018, 19:18 - TJ Musiitwa: You can't go via an agent as well right?
01/07/2018, 19:19 - Liz: I kinda need it.   Getting updates about the country and the uni applications... 
But also I need to know how my hunny is doing and see more cute pics😊😋
01/07/2018, 19:20 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha honey can always reach you via email and can also send pictures there as well
01/07/2018, 19:21 - Liz: It shows that use Mobile money to pay... And if u go they need ur pin code to activate but I HV none of the above
01/07/2018, 19:21 - TJ Musiitwa: But I can understand the need for updates basing on uni applications
01/07/2018, 19:21 - TJ Musiitwa: Wait you get your country updates via social media
01/07/2018, 19:21 - Liz: 😝 aryt I await... Just incase
01/07/2018, 19:22 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah it might now be all about the thing of going to the service centers will lots of lines...and what not
01/07/2018, 19:24 - Liz: Yeah... Pipo in my class group know many things...
Like many news updates so u can know even if ur not watching news or something....
01/07/2018, 19:24 - Liz: And that is like soon
01/07/2018, 19:24 - TJ Musiitwa: Oh okay
01/07/2018, 19:24 - Liz: Just to pay 200
01/07/2018, 19:25 - TJ Musiitwa: This process was not thought through effectively by the government...to just go all of a sudden announce this week or was it early June and implement a month down the road...
01/07/2018, 19:27 - TJ Musiitwa: They told people but they did not make it obvious enough to the citizens like raise enough awareness ever day or week to inform people it was just in the last week the boom.... everyone off
01/07/2018, 19:28 - Liz: I personally didn't take it serious..
01/07/2018, 19:29 - Liz: I thought there is this one solution that will surely work🤷🏽‍♀..
01/07/2018, 19:30 - Liz: They only thought about themselves and how they would benefit
01/07/2018, 19:30 - TJ Musiitwa: Apparently wanting to cut down on dependence on foreign donations
01/07/2018, 19:31 - TJ Musiitwa: What if for a start they started by reducing MPs salary...
01/07/2018, 19:31 - TJ Musiitwa: You see...
01/07/2018, 19:32 - Liz: I know right..... They really don't help us so much
01/07/2018, 19:33 - Liz: 🤔 I don't want to register my mobile money in other pipos names. I want to get my national id and I register for myself
01/07/2018, 19:33 - Liz: But there is a solution..
01/07/2018, 19:35 - TJ Musiitwa: And what's the solution?
01/07/2018, 19:36 - TJ Musiitwa: The problem is that they didn't even allow people to pay for others....what problem is there on having someone else pay the same tax they pay for you🤷🏾‍♂🤦🏾‍♂
01/07/2018, 19:37 - Liz: Email🤷🏽‍♀... VPN WiFi .. But I'm not using SMS.... Or opposition members should strike..
01/07/2018, 19:37 - Liz: 😕 this is just thea nonsense...
01/07/2018, 19:38 - TJ Musiitwa: More like the president's...
01/07/2018, 19:39 - TJ Musiitwa: Okay then well hopefully your VPN holds out for a while
01/07/2018, 19:40 - Liz: I hope... I'm even losing social media hype🚶🏽‍♀
01/07/2018, 19:42 - TJ Musiitwa: This alone would also make me lose hype for social media that's for sure
01/07/2018, 19:44 - Liz: Its. Just too much.. And pipo are still offline. Also because no one works
01/07/2018, 19:46 - TJ Musiitwa: Ok babe I feel you getting a bit worked up on this topic...I feel your anger... so let's switch the subject... or if you wish to continue....I am fine by it...
01/07/2018, 19:48 - Liz: Switch. Switch
01/07/2018, 19:50 - TJ Musiitwa: So did you brush the roof today...😅😅

01/07/2018, 20:42 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah that two but after pregnancy they more or less go back to normal...I think.. maybe
01/07/2018, 20:44 - Liz: I'm going off chilla but I'm not turning off data just incase
01/07/2018, 20:46 - TJ Musiitwa: No problemo
01/07/2018, 20:53 - Liz: Yeah.... Some do but I can only say I'm scared of getting pregnant. Not because I don't want child but of how I'll look after....
01/07/2018, 20:56 - TJ Musiitwa: That is the fear among many if not all women you will.come.across.
The post maternity look is something that is an issue for them
01/07/2018, 20:56 - TJ Musiitwa: And I have read about it time and again
01/07/2018, 20:57 - TJ Musiitwa: But the thing to remember is that your partner is meant to praise you for the 9 months of carrying a wonderful new humans and birthing them into the world.
01/07/2018, 20:58 - TJ Musiitwa: An informed and literatr husband knows and understands the changes his wife will go through and is ready to accept them
01/07/2018, 20:58 - TJ Musiitwa: In fact he even looks past them...
01/07/2018, 20:59 - TJ Musiitwa: If I can committing to a lifetime with you, I am not going to be focusing on how your body will look like after pregnancies...I know and I will appreciate you even after...
01/07/2018, 20:59 - TJ Musiitwa: Life giving is a precious gift...
01/07/2018, 21:00 - TJ Musiitwa: And you should know right now, even after all the children we may have, you will still be the wife and woman I want to wake up the rest of my life to
01/07/2018, 21:04 - Liz: Aaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!
01/07/2018, 21:05 - Liz: That's so sweet... I CNT help but blush on this one
01/07/2018, 21:05 - Liz: 😊😊😊....#feeling loved
01/07/2018, 21:06 - TJ Musiitwa: You should know I think very differently when it comes to love...my girlfriend and my family...I am all in
01/07/2018, 21:07 - TJ Musiitwa: _PS: star the messages_
01/07/2018, 21:07 - Liz: 😹😹😹 already dd
01/07/2018, 21:08 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha 😊👌🏾
01/07/2018, 21:10 - Liz: Wat led to this was that I read some article.. This guy was telling his story... And in the middle he said....my wife had become unappealing and disgusting after giving birth to our second child and I felt like I didn't want to return home anymore.... So he explained that is wat made him get his other wife
01/07/2018, 21:12 - TJ Musiitwa: And then he gets the 2nd wife pregnant and then what happens...she also becomes ugly and disgusting
01/07/2018, 21:13 - TJ Musiitwa: Besides I've seen mom's go through pregnancy and come back to how they were before... it's possible...so really why would a guy be that kind of way
01/07/2018, 21:16 - Liz: 🤷🏽‍♀🤷🏽‍♀🤷🏽‍♀ idk I didn't follow up the story but they stayed together for like 7years and he wasn't ashamed of showing the new wife to the old one... Since he thought it was okay
01/07/2018, 21:18 - Liz: Its possible if u want it... And HV the money... Some. Women are too excited about the baby and they forget the husband and their bodies
01/07/2018, 21:23 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha well being excited about the baby isn't bad...but hey you just be you when it's your time, your family and friends will continue to appreciate you as you are
01/07/2018, 21:23 - TJ Musiitwa: When it's our turn
01/07/2018, 21:27 - Liz: 🙂🙂🙂 hmmm okay
01/07/2018, 21:31 - Liz: I just hope I don't get bad mood swings😪 those things even make me fear myself
01/07/2018, 21:32 - TJ Musiitwa: Baby calm down ok....it won't be you alone in this...it will be you and I...ok dear
01/07/2018, 21:33 - TJ Musiitwa: All these fears sure you have them now..... that's for sure but as you grow up hopefully the pain doesn't do you down
01/07/2018, 21:35 - TJ Musiitwa: I don't know if I think you will be getting some Ssenga talk or mom talk about all this down the road...but they especially mom will be your best supporter in this. She knows it best
01/07/2018, 21:37 - Liz: 🤣🤣🤣🤣 pliiiizzzz no senga talks I don't trust any sengas
01/07/2018, 21:39 - Liz: I'll stick to my mam I'm sure she's the best true lover I HV well apart from u ..

01/07/2018, 21:46 - Liz: Mahhhhnnnn u don't know my aunties....  They might not even care until wen ur almost married.... And others u sort urself😹 free family....
01/07/2018, 21:46 - Liz: Or others are too formal.... They need u behaving as if a white child
01/07/2018, 21:48 - Liz: And most of the things I hv learnt I teach myself or I here my mum giving pipo advise and I just listen and try to remember... Or just reading articles😊
01/07/2018, 21:48 - Liz: 😊😊😊😊
01/07/2018, 21:52 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha then they start bombarding you with all the advice?
01/07/2018, 21:53 - TJ Musiitwa: Btw how is your cousin Elizabeth (the baby)..have you been to see her yet
01/07/2018, 21:54 - Liz: She was okay wen I saw her😹... Then she flew out of the country and is staying idk where
01/07/2018, 21:55 - Liz: Yeahhhh..... Atee me I don't like being told things I know....

08/07/2018, 12:50 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha remember I said I only get like 40 views max, that isn't alot.... really...compared to your 60
08/07/2018, 12:52 - Liz: Minimum is??? I mean for you

08/07/2018, 12:55 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha kinda yeah
08/07/2018, 12:55 - Liz: People in your contact list are probably busy as compared to mine... My friends are literary watsapp people they are like always there to see wat is on everyone's status
08/07/2018, 12:57 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha maybe or cause I just don't have that many people who I contact am in contact with....small number is better for me... And yeah also I blocked certain people from serimg my status posts as well... Around like 20 or so
08/07/2018, 13:00 - Liz: Also that maybe...
08/07/2018, 13:00 - Liz: Hihi I think everyone blocked certain people from there status
08/07/2018, 13:01 - TJ Musiitwa: Also because the people in my list are not all that posting kind on WhatsApp and post more on Snapchat or Instagram...
08/07/2018, 13:01 - TJ Musiitwa: At least from my perspective so that also counts
08/07/2018, 13:03 - Liz: Ohhhh so mainly on snap chat and IG???
08/07/2018, 13:04 - Liz: I'm not used to posting on IG😊
08/07/2018, 13:04 - TJ Musiitwa: 1 of the contributing factors... That is mainly with the people from here not Ugandan.... mainly here...
08/07/2018, 13:05 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha and with mine you also won't expect me to post alot there as well
08/07/2018, 13:06 - Liz: 😂 eehhh this is so us!!!!

09/07/2018, 20:13 - TJ Musiitwa: Well the fair thing to do would be to hear them out and get reasons why they want to do photography
09/07/2018, 20:14 - TJ Musiitwa: Then tell them that they could do that as a side hobby but would need to focus on something more practical... To better their lives
09/07/2018, 20:15 - Liz: Okay that's cool but think of it as its either photography or nothing
09/07/2018, 20:18 - TJ Musiitwa: Hmm I would say find a compromise....or better yet argue it out but push the idea that it can and should be a side thing

11/07/2018, 20:46 - TJ Musiitwa: Cause you and I have something together so I should try and know what is going on....why you ain't answering me for over 2 months
11/07/2018, 20:47 - Liz: Maybe  because  I'm going g through  a process
11/07/2018, 20:48 - Liz: Wat if
11/07/2018, 20:49 - TJ Musiitwa: Which kind of process?
11/07/2018, 21:06 - Liz: Jst me shutting  out pipo
11/07/2018, 21:06 - Liz: 😹😹😹
11/07/2018, 21:07 - Liz: Any who I don't know  what I would be doing not replying  for a year banae🤔
11/07/2018, 21:08 - TJ Musiitwa: Well just don't shut out your family... solitude could lead to depression which could lead to suicide (real thing btw)
11/07/2018, 21:08 - TJ Musiitwa: Some people can
11/07/2018, 21:08 - TJ Musiitwa: So who are you casting your hat in to win the WC?
11/07/2018, 21:10 - Liz: I can't...  Especially  for you
11/07/2018, 21:13 - TJ Musiitwa: Well I would understand....
11/07/2018, 21:13 - TJ Musiitwa: Sometimes some people need their own time....
11/07/2018, 21:15 - Liz: I'm still confused 😭 ever  Since Belgium  ND Brazil left
11/07/2018, 21:17 - Liz: One year
11/07/2018, 21:18 - TJ Musiitwa: Each person has their own time....that they might need....but (some) humans being social people, a year without talking to friends and family is too no big deal for them
11/07/2018, 21:21 - Liz: Well we all happen to be different
11/07/2018, 21:24 - TJ Musiitwa: True that
11/07/2018, 21:27 - Liz: But I don't  think I could shut out pipo for days  unless  it's something  very huge it affected me so much
11/07/2018, 21:31 - Liz: Did u change  ur dp it looks  cute BTW

11/07/2018, 21:51 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha I totally understand this fear...
11/07/2018, 21:51 - TJ Musiitwa: It's isn't fun having to go taxi-wise
11/07/2018, 21:52 - TJ Musiitwa: The constant stops and what not...
11/07/2018, 21:52 - TJ Musiitwa: But hey you got Uber could do a ride hail straight to the hospital
11/07/2018, 21:52 - TJ Musiitwa: Or a home birth (if you think that is a thing you could do)😁
11/07/2018, 21:53 - Liz: Ik I could probably  puke or faint 😹😹😹 Gene
11/07/2018, 21:54 - TJ Musiitwa: Woah lets not think that way...think happy thoughts...
11/07/2018, 21:54 - TJ Musiitwa: Besides most of what I think you could be imagining is from the movies...
11/07/2018, 21:54 - Liz: Everything  about  them being squeezed  ND proper sitting  posture  ND then no air that's serious
11/07/2018, 21:54 - TJ Musiitwa: *I think*
11/07/2018, 21:55 - Liz: 🤣 eeehhh banae I'll be too depressed  to think about ubers
11/07/2018, 21:56 - TJ Musiitwa: The nausea sensation....I gotta tell you a mother is a strong lady...if she is able to walk through a desert to a hospital somewhere in Africa...she is able to stand a warm taxi
11/07/2018, 21:56 - Liz: Hihihi not really but I know  myself  I'm not so strong  ND I hv too much kyegyo so I know  Wat might happen
11/07/2018, 21:57 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha but they are an option not to be thrown out of the window
11/07/2018, 21:57 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha _kyegyo-much_
11/07/2018, 21:58 - Liz: I totally agree  but still by the time  I feel nauseated  in a normal taxi ND I'm not pregnant what might happen  if I'm pregnant 🤷🏽‍♀🤷🏽‍♀ u see Wat I mean???
11/07/2018, 22:00 - Liz: Okay true but hmm I'll probably just find a car or something  for emergency
11/07/2018, 22:00 - Liz: Yeah thats one thing u probably  didn't  know
11/07/2018, 22:00 - TJ Musiitwa: I hear you totally

11/07/2018, 22:08 - TJ Musiitwa: Because surely behind the facade of humble quiet lady... There has to be some kyegyo

13/07/2018, 18:08 - TJ Musiitwa: I'll talk to my photographer friend and see his take of what could be good locations and see
13/07/2018, 18:08 - TJ Musiitwa: Or unless you have any considerations
13/07/2018, 18:09 - Liz: 😊😊😊 okay...

13/07/2018, 18:12 - TJ Musiitwa: Nope he doesn't. He put up a charge sheet for his services so I should expect that they remain constant
13/07/2018, 18:14 - Liz: Or we can do the beach first
13/07/2018, 18:14 - Liz: 👀
13/07/2018, 18:15 - TJ Musiitwa: If that's what you want then ok

13/07/2018, 20:20 - Liz: Wat do u see
13/07/2018, 20:20 - TJ Musiitwa: <Media omitted>
13/07/2018, 20:22 - TJ Musiitwa: <Media omitted>
13/07/2018, 20:25 - Liz: Hmmmm
13/07/2018, 20:39 - TJ Musiitwa: 😁
13/07/2018, 20:42 - Liz: Okay then we shall go😳
13/07/2018, 21:17 - TJ Musiitwa: When you do these things don't start by offering words...
Show a picture that gets the people talking
13/07/2018, 21:17 - Liz: No I don't want to expose  the boy
13/07/2018, 21:18 - Liz: What if I break  people's  hearts😹...
13/07/2018, 21:18 - TJ Musiitwa: But he tired of the single life means he is ready to get out there so gots to  do alot of advertising
13/07/2018, 21:18 - TJ Musiitwa: You mean the hearts of the crushes
13/07/2018, 21:21 - Liz: Yes...  What if there is this girl who really likes him ND he has been showing  signs  of liking her back...  But now again  I'm advertising  him..  That means  she can easily  be heart broken  which  in this case I'm sure might happen
13/07/2018, 21:24 - TJ Musiitwa: Well the 2 people might as well get it over with and find out if they like each other...cause seemingly the guy likes the girl, but he does not seem to have told her...
13/07/2018, 21:24 - TJ Musiitwa: What's he waiting for
13/07/2018, 21:24 - Liz: His not sure if he likes her...  She likes him though 🤷🏽‍♀
13/07/2018, 21:25 - Liz: But he wants to be sure he wants this to be his final relationship  ND he settles  with someone  forever
13/07/2018, 21:25 - TJ Musiitwa: Ah so 1 sided....
13/07/2018, 21:27 - TJ Musiitwa: Oh okay well to be real we can never really know that the person will be our final relationship... really until it's all locked down in a wedding or engagement....
13/07/2018, 21:27 - Liz: Yeah  yeah so it's better I don't  put his pic there  but I'm just teasing  him
13/07/2018, 21:28 - TJ Musiitwa: So if we l he really thinks that he can make this his final relationship and he likes this girl he should go for it (live each day as it comes)...
13/07/2018, 21:29 - Liz: Yeah... But we always try to make  things  work if we really love  this person
13/07/2018, 21:29 - TJ Musiitwa: He should not think of this as his final relationship....but as a step in that direction....for now he will just have to go in and hope that he can take it that far...
13/07/2018, 21:30 - TJ Musiitwa: It might not work out for the other person but it might for him and vice versa
13/07/2018, 21:31 - TJ Musiitwa: That is true hence it takes time to find this person.... dating is all about this learning about this person
13/07/2018, 21:31 - TJ Musiitwa: Ready to take that baggage that they might bring
13/07/2018, 21:32 - TJ Musiitwa: It will most definitely not be immediate,  boom I like the his person forever and they will be the one for me forever
13/07/2018, 21:33 - TJ Musiitwa: He's just gonna have to take a leap of faith with this girl who clearly likes him, seemingly alot and hope that it works out
13/07/2018, 22:35 - TJ Musiitwa: Goodnight honey and happy anniversary to you to us.
I love you
13/07/2018, 22:35 - TJ Musiitwa: 💞

14/07/2018, 10:05 - Liz: From  deep down in  my archives
14/07/2018, 10:06 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha I'm amazed
14/07/2018, 10:09 - Liz: I was wondering  how I was supposed  to do that...  I don't  know  how to do things  when people  ask me to do them...  Im better off doing certain  things at my own pace or something but if people  ask me I rarely do them as good
14/07/2018, 10:09 - Liz: I liked  that one for today
14/07/2018, 10:11 - TJ Musiitwa: I understand well a relief that you don't have to change anything you were doing for me as you were already doing it indirectly but you didn't know it😊

14/07/2018, 10:29 - Liz: Yeah... I've heard my friends  going  to pearl of Africa hotel
14/07/2018, 10:29 - TJ Musiitwa: So if we don't use oil in our hair then that leads to poor hair...hmm
14/07/2018, 10:29 - Liz: Swimming  should be free of charge
14/07/2018, 10:30 - TJ Musiitwa: Naah there are costs... filters, water etc... only free if you actually stay at the hotel
14/07/2018, 10:30 - Liz: 🤭 it can't be as good as ours... We hot comb..put hair oils bluh bluh ND then u guys just wash with soap ND go on
14/07/2018, 10:31 - Liz: Okay maybe  I'm just imagining  if it was free🤭 then everyone  would swim
14/07/2018, 10:32 - TJ Musiitwa: Hmm some people can do all that and still have poor hair
14/07/2018, 10:33 - TJ Musiitwa: And the person who uses water and soap is better
14/07/2018, 10:34 - Liz: then they naturally  have  poor hair 🤷🏽‍♀

14/07/2018, 19:24 - Liz: But if you learn how to wear them it gets easier
14/07/2018, 19:25 - TJ Musiitwa: Still eh compared to the rest

14/07/2018, 19:38 - TJ Musiitwa: Well I would wonder if I should be worried that the gomesi won't fall off or anything
14/07/2018, 19:39 - Liz: Not about  gomesis
14/07/2018, 19:42 - TJ Musiitwa: So about what

17/07/2018, 19:49 - Liz: BTW I'm now feeling  guilty 😭 I over meet ur mum and I never greet her...  I have  a feeling  she  knows  me or something
17/07/2018, 19:53 - TJ Musiitwa: You met her again today?
17/07/2018, 19:53 - TJ Musiitwa: Going to get your paperwork
17/07/2018, 19:54 - Liz: Yes I met her
17/07/2018, 19:55 - Liz: And I felt I had bad manners...  She looked  at me like  thrice then she went😰
17/07/2018, 19:56 - TJ Musiitwa: Like you directly met her or just passing by sort of thing
17/07/2018, 20:00 - Liz: I was standing  asking my friend  something  then she was passing  by
17/07/2018, 20:01 - TJ Musiitwa: Oh okay well in that case she had somewhere to be so I think it's a good thing.
17/07/2018, 20:02 - TJ Musiitwa: But just work up the courage one day when you meet her and say hello
17/07/2018, 20:03 - TJ Musiitwa: Say you are Livia and Jonathan's friend, going to do/or doing law(maybe if you meet her after the semester starts)
17/07/2018, 20:03 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha....
17/07/2018, 20:04 - Liz: 😥😥😥 are u sure it will work.....
17/07/2018, 20:04 - Liz: Bambi today  I felt bad  again...  Kyoka I was lost
17/07/2018, 20:07 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah...she will ask which school you were from and all that but after that it will be cool....but I don't think the way we have done it most times is that we usually introduce our friends to our parents first...so now I don't know
17/07/2018, 20:08 - TJ Musiitwa: If you want to go the 1st route go right ahead...if you want the 2nd option then yeah
17/07/2018, 20:08 - Liz: Okay...  But I still can't 😭😭😭😭😭
17/07/2018, 20:09 - TJ Musiitwa: Then don't really fret about it
17/07/2018, 20:09 - Liz: I want the second  option 😹 but then I'll continue  feeling bad
17/07/2018, 20:10 - TJ Musiitwa: It's a matter of time until either Livia or I introduce you to her so you will be alright
17/07/2018, 20:10 - TJ Musiitwa: Then 2nd option it is
17/07/2018, 20:11 - TJ Musiitwa: But think of it this way, if you had never seen any picture of my mom, you would just see her like any other lady...
17/07/2018, 20:12 - TJ Musiitwa: You don't go around greeting every other lady....even if they could your cousin's uncle's nephew's side chic baby mama
🤷🏾‍♂
17/07/2018, 20:12 - Liz: Okay cool😊 I'll just wait I hope I don't  have  another encounter  with her...

17/07/2018, 20:26 - Liz: Yes...  Eeehhh his being  unappreciative.. I made him laugh many times
17/07/2018, 20:27 - Liz: So why is he saying  women  are not funny...  I'm I a man🤣🤣🤣

18/07/2018, 21:48 - Liz: Many Nigerians that side??
18/07/2018, 21:50 - TJ Musiitwa: You would not believe it but then also because of what could be the bad things they have been reported to do ...I guess Malaysia is kinda starting to cut down on their visas as their behaviours reflect upon all other countries
18/07/2018, 21:51 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah I've even seen some who got married to Asian women here had brown children
18/07/2018, 21:52 - TJ Musiitwa: But ask any Malaysian to guess which country you are from and they will say Nigeria 1st
18/07/2018, 21:52 - TJ Musiitwa: Uganda isn't known by many

27/07/2018, 10:49 - Liz: Haha.   Yeah..   Affidavit  is easy
27/07/2018, 12:04 - TJ Musiitwa: Because it is testing the bonds of the 2 people to see how far they can go and still come back to fight each other
27/07/2018, 12:04 - TJ Musiitwa: *find
27/07/2018, 12:06 - Liz: Isn't that so cruel...  Why don't  they just stay together  if they are brought  together? 😪
27/07/2018, 12:07 - TJ Musiitwa: Because even the hardest of metals are broken down in order to build them up stronger
27/07/2018, 12:09 - Liz: 🤭 ooohhh...
27/07/2018, 12:11 - TJ Musiitwa: Hence we can and will keep trying to come together....we are battle tested....
27/07/2018, 12:11 - TJ Musiitwa: So even with whatever distance we are far apart, we know where we shall come back to
27/07/2018, 12:12 - TJ Musiitwa: Although of course it is alot harder when we are near each other then it is really hard...
27/07/2018, 12:14 - Liz: And each time  we come back  we become  stronger 😊
27/07/2018, 12:14 - Liz: ?
27/07/2018, 12:14 - TJ Musiitwa: Exactly...
27/07/2018, 12:16 - Liz: Hehe
27/07/2018, 12:22 - TJ Musiitwa: I mean being far away means that if I have the urge to see you....I can't necessarily get a cab and come see you...
But being so near... it's hard to resist the urge not to
27/07/2018, 13:13 - Liz: 😅😅😅😋😋😋😋

29/07/2018, 19:43 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha not that kind of hurt....you know how a muscle pool feels like....yeah that's how it is....no need for the pain killers.

30/07/2018, 19:06 - Liz: But I got a friend  who should  actually  give  me her place  without  hustling  but well I don't  know  the process of these things
30/07/2018, 19:07 - TJ Musiitwa: And if a guy does something like that, we are rubbish🤷🏾‍♂
30/07/2018, 19:07 - TJ Musiitwa: She's going elsewhere
30/07/2018, 19:09 - Liz: Can a guy even?

30/07/2018, 19:45 - TJ Musiitwa: Could be because I wore my hoodie the entire day....
30/07/2018, 19:45 - TJ Musiitwa: With a long sleeved shirt underneath
30/07/2018, 19:45 - TJ Musiitwa: All cause I didn't want to feel sleepy later

31/07/2018, 15:15 - TJ Musiitwa: Not really nope
31/07/2018, 15:20 - Liz: Hehe wow!!!
31/07/2018, 15:22 - Liz: Ours at gongos went very wrong the dropper microphones weren't working...  Too much wind it blew away almost all the decorations😹... Then the founder of the school. Made a long speech insulting  even  the directors Gwe.golden jubilee  was crazy
31/07/2018, 15:25 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha well I was not there for 2006 100 years celebration but that one should have been crazier
31/07/2018, 15:30 - Liz: I bet it was... Daymmnnn
31/07/2018, 15:34 - TJ Musiitwa: So how's your Tuesday been
31/07/2018, 15:34 - TJ Musiitwa: Any accidental bumpings into my mom or dad
31/07/2018, 15:34 - TJ Musiitwa: Today😄😁
31/07/2018, 15:36 - Liz: 😝😝😝 nahhhhh...  At least today I was moving fast in a car...  I didn't  bump into anyone
31/07/2018, 15:38 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha well what a relief 😅
31/07/2018, 15:39 - Liz: Why???
31/07/2018, 15:39 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha for you that is
31/07/2018, 15:41 - Liz: 😊 of course  eehhhhh...  My blood pressure increases to 86ooo!!!
31/07/2018, 16:20 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha ojakuba bulungi
31/07/2018, 17:30 - TJ Musiitwa: Have you ever heard of something called the mammalian dive reflex?
31/07/2018, 18:02 - Liz: Nop
31/07/2018, 18:06 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha well it is an interesting thing to find out
31/07/2018, 18:07 - TJ Musiitwa: Well ideally what it is, is the reflexive action our bodies go into when we submerge into water or when we deep our face into say a basin of water
31/07/2018, 18:08 - TJ Musiitwa: Like you know that feeling when you can momentarily hold your breath under water
31/07/2018, 18:08 - TJ Musiitwa: Yup that's the reflex...
31/07/2018, 18:08 - TJ Musiitwa: This is all in adults
31/07/2018, 18:09 - TJ Musiitwa: Now in infants it expresses itself in a funny way ..let's just say I would love our babies to learn swimming from a young age
31/07/2018, 18:10 - TJ Musiitwa: Because when infants say fall are in a pool per say, they are able to float as well as swim and hold their breaths easily under water....
31/07/2018, 18:11 - TJ Musiitwa: Hence they can learn to swim earlier and conquer fears of water
31/07/2018, 18:11 - TJ Musiitwa: You should see the videos to believe it
31/07/2018, 18:21 - Liz: Okay....
31/07/2018, 18:25 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha too much information...😁
31/07/2018, 18:26 - Liz: 😂😂😂 Yea..
31/07/2018, 18:26 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha well just
31/07/2018, 18:27 - Liz: U watched the videos?
31/07/2018, 18:28 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah and they are quite something... imagine someone the age of your cousin, Elizabeth swimming in a pool and floating...on their own
31/07/2018, 18:30 - Liz: Can't they drown or something
31/07/2018, 18:31 - TJ Musiitwa: Well of course they aren't swimming in their own some one is their to help them but if you submerge them they are able to come up to the top easily
31/07/2018, 18:38 - Liz: Eehhhhh too risky..  What if my child  drowns..
31/07/2018, 18:38 - Liz: At least  2years
31/07/2018, 18:39 - TJ Musiitwa: Which is why lessons are not more than 10 minutes... only 10 minutes is enough to put the learning sense in them.... also it is done by professionals
31/07/2018, 18:41 - Liz: Hmmm
31/07/2018, 18:41 - TJ Musiitwa: I would like to give it a shot for sure...
31/07/2018, 18:42 - TJ Musiitwa: It might not be very frequent that's okay but at least one shot and see how it goes

02/08/2018, 20:23 - Liz: Because  I want u to miss me😃😃😃
02/08/2018, 20:24 - Liz: 😹 I doubt.. I didn't  even  find any I miss u message..  Eeehhh
02/08/2018, 20:28 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha well you should not be worried about that.
I miss you every single day.
It could be because I have gotten a lot more busier and put my final year project at centre thought over these last few weeks but I still have you in my mind as well as wear you as a smile each time I look at your pictures. No doubt at all, I miss you, I just haven't been saying it(my bad) but I keep it in thought
02/08/2018, 20:29 - TJ Musiitwa: Sawa let he come back saying she's hungry
Go and find the chapter of Jesus feeding the 5000 you will get fish and bread😄
02/08/2018, 20:35 - Liz: 😹😹😹😹 of course  I know  u were so busy I was just messing
02/08/2018, 20:35 - Liz: 😂😂😂😂  I'll not come back
02/08/2018, 20:37 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha guess that means between the 2 of us you are the one more hyper and the joker
02/08/2018, 20:39 - Liz: Yeah so true..  I can't even  deny this.... Ur the serious  one
02/08/2018, 20:39 - TJ Musiitwa: Exactly so why are you sending me to go sit with Moses...by the fire..while that will keep me warm that isn't the warm that I want...
Need I point you to the book of Kings where Solomon says something in the lines of where two people lie together they can be warm together but colder apart
02/08/2018, 20:41 - Liz: 🤣 I'll not come  back  because  I'll be having  good food
02/08/2018, 20:41 - Liz: From  the Bible
02/08/2018, 20:42 - TJ Musiitwa: Fish and bread you ever had that....is it good
02/08/2018, 20:44 - Liz: Yes it's yummy actually..  Better than pasta and fries
02/08/2018, 20:44 - TJ Musiitwa: Cheii you are kidding... again of cos you are...
02/08/2018, 20:45 - TJ Musiitwa: You will have to make for me something good with fish and bread before I believe you
02/08/2018, 20:46 - Liz: 😂 come come...   Elizabeth  Fried fish and bread at ur service
02/08/2018, 20:47 - Liz: I am...  Just  never take me serious  about  anything  I'm always  kidding unless I tell u I'm serious
02/08/2018, 20:47 - TJ Musiitwa: Anti kale
02/08/2018, 20:48 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah we did have a conversation on this I think over a year ago...and I think you should recall that I was a bit angry when you told me you were kidding over something I don't remember....
02/08/2018, 20:49 - TJ Musiitwa: Never take you seriously....I don't know if I could not do so...
One moment you could be like you are choking and I'd just say naah you joking..
02/08/2018, 20:50 - TJ Musiitwa: The next I have to explain to your cousins why I let you die
02/08/2018, 20:50 - Liz: 😅😅 I don't  remember...  But I sound so real while kidding Or u take things  seriously  so much..

02/08/2018, 20:52 - TJ Musiitwa: 🤷🏾‍♂
02/08/2018, 20:53 - TJ Musiitwa: I guess that's me, I take things seriously maybe not all the time but where it comes to my family and those that I care about....I do take it all seriously
02/08/2018, 20:53 - Liz: 😹 no don't
02/08/2018, 20:54 - Liz: 😅😅😅😅  it's just u.  I guess
02/08/2018, 20:57 - TJ Musiitwa: Well some of the things you should be ready to deal with having me around
02/08/2018, 20:57 - Liz: Meanwhile  I was just attending  Tendo's birthday  .. I don't  know if u remember  him
02/08/2018, 20:57 - TJ Musiitwa: You have told me about him before... but I might remember the face and not the name

02/08/2018, 21:12 - TJ Musiitwa: Eating starts from home, but it doesn't end there
02/08/2018, 21:12 - TJ Musiitwa: Don't feel nervous about eating out of home
02/08/2018, 21:12 - TJ Musiitwa: Also when was your last deworming😁😅

Happy anniversary to the woman who stole my heart and continues to be the person I fight for to get us to the ultimate goal together, you+me down the aisle.
My heart, my love, my joy, my comfort, my pride all this and more because I have you.
I love you, Elizabeth

19/08/2018, 13:39 - Liz: This message was deleted
19/08/2018, 13:39 - Liz: I was just playing
19/08/2018, 13:39 - Liz: I really  didn't want the pics she had put on her status so I wanted u to wait and see the master piece 😊 but then🤷🏽‍♀
19/08/2018, 14:12 - TJ Musiitwa: I didn't care about what pictures she put
19/08/2018, 14:13 - TJ Musiitwa: I was only looking for a simple Y/N to my Q.
Done.
19/08/2018, 17:42 - TJ Musiitwa: Are you busy? I wish to talk to you
19/08/2018, 17:46 - Liz: I can't speak now but I cn text
19/08/2018, 17:47 - TJ Musiitwa: Oh okay. What I would like to say would best be said over the phone such that you hear the emotion in my voice because really text can't do it justice.
19/08/2018, 17:48 - TJ Musiitwa: I wish to explain what I said, hopefully because you probably could have taken it the wrong way given that I didn't complete it properly.
19/08/2018, 17:50 - Liz: Well if u could wait like one hour  I'll be out of where I am  now
19/08/2018, 17:50 - Liz: then u will call

19/08/2018, 21:12 - Liz: well I  realized I might have over played but I didn't think it was too much but I'm sorry too
19/08/2018, 21:26 - TJ Musiitwa: Yes i understand, I don't want to limit you on your having fun and you should continue having fun.
I should guess that you do this to your friends.
However by establishing that I have sort of threshold would be good going forward....like after about 3/4 back and forths then back to reality. That would be good.
19/08/2018, 21:27 - TJ Musiitwa: ```True what might seem good in our perspectives might resonate differently with people other that ourselves```
19/08/2018, 21:33 - TJ Musiitwa: All in all, I will say this, you looked beautiful again as always🙂
19/08/2018, 21:34 - TJ Musiitwa: As I said before, you keep at it you might just get a contractual agreement to do face modelling😁
19/08/2018, 21:35 - Liz: Thanks🙂
19/08/2018, 21:41 - TJ Musiitwa: You're welcome
19/08/2018, 22:00 - Liz: But I was actually really pissed by this one..  I honestly felt so terrible 😪  as if a bad person but it's okay.. I'll just be fine
19/08/2018, 22:08 - TJ Musiitwa: Yes I felt terrible about that one but that was me in the heat of the moment, I apologize.
19/08/2018, 22:10 - TJ Musiitwa: And to be really honest with you for a moment there with the silence between us, I really felt scared of losing you.
Surely there will be some days where we aren't on the same page of things, but I hope we can come back as we have now.
19/08/2018, 22:11 - TJ Musiitwa: <Media omitted>
19/08/2018, 22:35 - TJ Musiitwa: Goodnight Elizabeth
19/08/2018, 23:46 - Liz: This message was deleted

20/08/2018, 00:10 - Liz: 😨 I wasn't even thinking about that...  I felt too stressed to reply.. I Practically didn't know what to reply and I was so hurt and scared..

24/08/2018, 17:14 - TJ Musiitwa: Btw can I pick your mind real quick...what are your thoughts on say gentlemen who marry say women above and beyond their ages...or have a large age gap....
Say 26 year old guy with a 35 year old woman?
24/08/2018, 17:30 - Liz: Large age gap like..30 and 24???
24/08/2018, 17:31 - TJ Musiitwa: Like 26 year guy with 35 year old woman
24/08/2018, 17:34 - Liz: Wel l can I just give a non detailed answer
24/08/2018, 17:34 - TJ Musiitwa: No problem whatever comes to mind
24/08/2018, 17:38 - Liz: I think it all comes back to one thing.. Love.. If they love each other and not materialism.. The age bracket sometimes doesn't matter whether who is older but as long as u can make complete each other u can move mountains have a good life and life is okat
24/08/2018, 17:40 - Liz: But also depends on whether the lady doesn't take him for granted.. Sometimes they tend to take the young men for granted🤷🏽‍♀
24/08/2018, 17:54 - TJ Musiitwa: Unha I get where you are coming from
24/08/2018, 17:55 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha okay true but if a younger guy is able to win her over then for sure I don't think she'd take him for granted
24/08/2018, 18:00 - Liz: Well depends..
24/08/2018, 18:01 - Liz: What if she won him over
24/08/2018, 18:21 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha well guy knows his taste then...the younger ladies failed him
24/08/2018, 18:26 - TJ Musiitwa: So he went for older riper wine
24/08/2018, 18:27 - Liz: Well okay  I understanding
24/08/2018, 18:27 - Liz: Understand***
24/08/2018, 18:32 - Liz: But idk if such relationships last

25/08/2018, 20:00 - TJ Musiitwa: Hmm I think I know of a place that could be like that.... just one though
25/08/2018, 20:01 - TJ Musiitwa: The reason I asked was just because you know how hard it is for ladies to pick a place they want to eat....
25/08/2018, 20:02 - TJ Musiitwa: So the trick guys use...is ask her where she thinks they're taking her to eat(she names a place) and then take her there

26/08/2018, 18:26 - Liz: Trying
26/08/2018, 18:27 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah well for me after formula 1 the week has officially began back to school and assignments
26/08/2018, 18:30 - Liz: Well  I dont know how we will manage this but I think I'll HV lots of reading to do these 4yearz
26/08/2018, 18:30 - Liz: 😄😄😄.  No more chills?
26/08/2018, 18:31 - TJ Musiitwa: Well a little here and there but not really as tense as the capstone project for sure
26/08/2018, 18:33 - TJ Musiitwa: Indeed you will and are going to be very busy.
That's why I will leave it in your hands to control...you decide how long we talk and that kind of stuff. You need to succeed and I should not stop you from that in anyway...I should and will be supporting you and rooting for you always
26/08/2018, 18:35 - Liz: Ohhh but maybe thats an indicator that soon u will b done
26/08/2018, 18:36 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah for sure
26/08/2018, 18:37 - Liz: Alright I'll see what I cn do but I hope this won't make us distant😪
26/08/2018, 18:38 - TJ Musiitwa: I too hope it won't. However we should possibly make it work because it is something that we both want
26/08/2018, 18:43 - TJ Musiitwa: It's 4 years honey, you've been able to deal with my 3 years long distance....I should be able to handle your 4 years. Besides, we can be able to use whatever small time we can get and appreciate it alot and use it. Whatever small time we get or small things we do, will go a long way in making out relationship stand the test of time.
Also because we have God to help us...
Also because I like you too much to not want to make it work with you☺
26/08/2018, 18:44 - Liz: I shall try to really make it work since I have ur support just help me out in any way u can...
26/08/2018, 18:46 - Liz: 😄😄 I'm seeing that by this u might want me married to u in less than 4years
26/08/2018, 18:46 - TJ Musiitwa: I WILL
26/08/2018, 18:47 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha heck if it were possible a lil crazy but possible if I had the money to support us both and make sure we can handle....it would possibly be less than 4 years😅
26/08/2018, 18:48 - TJ Musiitwa: But I'm gonna wait until my baby is done with law school and we see the steps to go after that
26/08/2018, 18:49 - TJ Musiitwa: The 1st year will be long but subsequently the years after will come by quickly and before you know it, it'll be LDC for you
26/08/2018, 18:52 - Liz: 😹😹 but u will get it even before 4years are done
26/08/2018, 18:52 - Liz: 🙈🙈🙈🙈 awww okay sure
26/08/2018, 18:53 - Liz: That's what I pray for... I feel stressed already but what can I do???
26/08/2018, 18:53 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha well🤞🏾
26/08/2018, 18:54 - TJ Musiitwa: But hey 4 years... more time to get to know my girlfriend even more...more time to grow each other... it'll be worth it.
26/08/2018, 18:54 - Liz: 🤔 isn't that the part u say amen
26/08/2018, 18:54 - TJ Musiitwa: Honey you are worth the wait

26/08/2018, 18:59 - Liz: But ur also worth the wait😄
26/08/2018, 19:01 - TJ Musiitwa: I mean that I look at things taking into perspective what I can see and how the world is currently, and not being hopeful in things...I am far less an optimist person and far more a realist
26/08/2018, 19:02 - TJ Musiitwa: <Media omitted>
26/08/2018, 19:05 - Liz: Well looking at every thing. I think u shall be successful but as ur about is.. Ur holding urself back... It might not be pretty soon but it will happen somehow .. U just need to be positive trust me

10/09/2018, 22:45 - TJ Musiitwa: You want to know something about long distance relationships that is kinda a downside?
10/09/2018, 22:45 - TJ Musiitwa: Well I mean there are alot of downsides but there's something that has just come to mind
10/09/2018, 22:46 - Liz: unha
10/09/2018, 22:47 - TJ Musiitwa: I am listening to this song I love it, that I think you would like...but the thing about long distance is that sharing the song or experiencing it ....
10/09/2018, 22:48 - TJ Musiitwa: When in close proximity it allows for greater feeling to enjoy the song.....as compared to sending the song..it just doesn't have the same feeling to it....
I don't know that's just me thinking that way
10/09/2018, 22:51 - TJ Musiitwa: Greater feeling like it would allow for you to see just how I experience the lyrics of the song.... the rhythm and all that... (When I am doing a kareoke of the song) and having you see that....
Sending the song... would kinda lose the weight behind the song....
I don't know that's just me I guess...
Do I sound crazy or corny right now🙂?
10/09/2018, 22:52 - Liz: Well I noticed that sometime back. Its very true... But u know there is nothing to do
10/09/2018, 22:52 - Liz: 😹😹😹😹 u don't sound.. Ur crazy.... About me and the song
10/09/2018, 22:54 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha well I'm glad I am not the only one
10/09/2018, 22:54 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha yup true

17/09/2018, 02:23 - TJ Musiitwa: Babe, what if I were to sneak into your dorm room tonight? I would sit next to your bed and look at your peaceful sleeping face, admiring your beauty and the peace that you exude. And I would wait until you wake up. Maybe you’d be startled once you open your eyes and see me, so I would tell you: It’s me, Babe. I was missing you so much that I decided to come and see you.

And you’ll smile back at me with those shiny blue gray eyes of yours, and your angelic face.


Babe, what if then I would raise my arms to give you a hug? Would you jump onto me and throw your arms around my neck? We would embrace each other for what would feel like a beautiful eternity. And I would run my fingers over your back, and caress your beautiful long hair. Then you will tell me: You are crazy, we cannot wake anyone up. They would not understand!

But the tone of your voice will give you away and I will know that you are really happy to see me. And you’ll make space for me in your tiny bed.

Babe, what if I then lay next to you, and we share your pillow while looking deep in each other’s eyes as our mouths find their way to each other? 
and through the warmth your body will tell me:
Come here, you crazy boy of mine. I’ve missed you so much that it hurts. You took a piece of my heart with you. And I want to be one with you right now!


Babe, what if I tell you that I cannot yet teleport to your room, as much as I wish I could? But what if me writing this and you reading it brings us together in mysterious ways? What if I tell you that this feels real to me? That in my brain my mirror neurons are actually caressing you, kissing you and loving you. That our connection is so deep that reading this will make your heart beat harder, your cheeks blush, your arms get goosebumps. And you will tell me: This is so hot that I won’t be able to fall asleep now. But I love you for writing this.
17/09/2018, 02:24 - TJ Musiitwa: Good morning dear, this is your wake-up have a lovely week 😊

27/09/2018, 14:59 - Liz: After us all reading and stuff the lecturer said he was disappointed😣 hmmmm
27/09/2018, 15:11 - TJ Musiitwa: Those law lecturers seem to have way of a high expectation of u students...but that's the price for being a person practicing the law
27/09/2018, 15:17 - Liz: But we read BTW.. But they don't appreciate😣 they actually believe we are so lazy.. The laziest class in the whole law xul
27/09/2018, 15:18 - TJ Musiitwa: That's just their tactic to force you to do better...you are already doing good very well but they want to see even better
27/09/2018, 15:19 - Liz: Its working I think😹
27/09/2018, 15:19 - TJ Musiitwa: I don't know how it works in the army but I guess it's the same....they abuse and demean you during army training to see if you can push yourself to succeed... because if you give up then they call you a shame if not then you earn the respect of commanding officers...
27/09/2018, 15:20 - TJ Musiitwa: If that works for the army...then guess it should work for you
27/09/2018, 15:20 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha you'll see the benefits later on I think
27/09/2018, 15:21 - Liz: And I'm growing smaller😭

13/10/2018, 08:38 - Liz: I'm not celebrating it.
13/10/2018, 08:38 - Liz: I'm African

13/10/2018, 15:14 - TJ Musiitwa: Hmm you and Matt how would that end up
13/10/2018, 17:57 - Liz: 😆😆😆 it would be funny

13/10/2018, 18:10 - TJ Musiitwa: Well I hope that while I might not replace a friend such as Matt, I can work up to being your best friend in the future
13/10/2018, 18:12 - Liz: If u marry ur best friend who will u talk to about things🤷🏽‍♀...
13/10/2018, 18:13 - Liz: Who will take u to funny places that u HV never seen for lunch..🤷🏽‍♀
13/10/2018, 18:14 - Liz: Many things best friends do..  I might feel like the friendship is broken even
13/10/2018, 18:14 - Liz: 😁😁😁well...
13/10/2018, 18:15 - TJ Musiitwa: So you don't want a best friend....
You just want a boyfriend, a friend, a husband etc....
13/10/2018, 18:16 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha you can talk about things with your best friend....who can also be your other half....
Or would that be too awkward for you
13/10/2018, 18:43 - Liz: U talk about things with ur best friend... Things u would probably not know from anywhere...
13/10/2018, 18:43 - Liz: For u? Or someone else
13/10/2018, 18:45 - TJ Musiitwa: Let's say for me?
13/10/2018, 18:47 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha well true you can talk about things elsewhere with someone else but if you are to live your life with someone for the rest of your life...I think calling them a friend and sharing with them everything wouldn't be a bad thing....
Just sayin
13/10/2018, 18:55 - Liz: Well a boyfriend can be made a best friend but a best friend made a boyfriend🤔 kinda weird
13/10/2018, 18:56 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha oh okay so that's the perspective you were looking at it from....I was taking it from the latter perspective
13/10/2018, 18:57 - Liz: Yes of course but u know you can't talk about everything with them🌚 like the surprise gifts or surprise party opinions...
13/10/2018, 18:58 - Liz: That's wat I was saying
13/10/2018, 19:02 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha of course those things are for the other friends

15/10/2018, 19:08 - TJ Musiitwa: Wow honey...so by the time law students are done you are basically librarians.... knowing where each book in the library belongs
15/10/2018, 19:09 - Liz: Nooooooooooo
15/10/2018, 19:09 - Liz: Yiyi
15/10/2018, 19:10 - TJ Musiitwa: Hahaha atee why not.... spending 80% of your time in the library doesn't warrant that you'd become librarians 😅
15/10/2018, 19:11 - Liz: Its just this week only
15/10/2018, 19:11 - Liz: The assignments contribute 30%

18/10/2018, 10:26 - TJ Musiitwa: Spread the word ....haha but really the thing is that some girls take the idea of nice guys as not being able to counter either their nice personality or being able to match their own bad girl personality...
That's my opinion

18/10/2018, 10:45 - TJ Musiitwa: Exactly probably some have and decided that naah the nice guys aren't for em hence the whole bad boys better, also the saying... Nice guys finish last

30/10/2018, 11:30 - TJ Musiitwa: And in suspense I'll continue to be
30/10/2018, 11:39 - Liz: Haha
30/10/2018, 11:39 - Liz: Ill just shock u
30/10/2018, 11:40 - Liz: <Media omitted>
30/10/2018, 11:40 - Liz: This is so deep
30/10/2018, 11:41 - TJ Musiitwa: I read you
30/10/2018, 11:41 - TJ Musiitwa: No doubt about that
30/10/2018, 11:41 - Liz: Its not mw
30/10/2018, 11:41 - Liz: Me
30/10/2018, 11:41 - Liz: .. I
30/10/2018, 11:41 - Liz: I just liked it😃
30/10/2018, 11:43 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha good to know
30/10/2018, 11:46 - Liz: This would be Livia BTW.. I'm so sure
30/10/2018, 11:47 - Liz: I'm so easy to impress right
30/10/2018, 12:00 - Liz: If ur lady gave ur friend a lap dance🤧 and she told u.. What would u do???
30/10/2018, 14:07 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha I guess so
30/10/2018, 14:07 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha you do have your moments where to impress is a slight challenge
30/10/2018, 14:13 - TJ Musiitwa: This would be a rare case because my friends would respect me and refuse the offer and they would understand it's wrong because they are my friends.
However given the context of the question, I would talk to my lady and be grateful that she was honest with me in the 1st place and that I got to know from her and not my friends. Secondly, I would then ask why it happened,  knowing she has a relationship with me(probably could be because she was getting something that I wasn't giving her, she would need  to tell me). Then have a serious talk with my friend and ask what and why the heck that happened.
Of course there would be some flare of anger before I got all the facts but then after I would evaluate after knowing what happened
30/10/2018, 14:17 - Liz: Really
30/10/2018, 14:17 - Liz: So my friend wants to break up with his girlfriend
30/10/2018, 14:17 - Liz: Just
30/10/2018, 14:18 - TJ Musiitwa: Just because of this....
30/10/2018, 14:20 - TJ Musiitwa: Well I would have to ask him if he's really ready to let go of her...if they have had good times together should one thing like this be the reason to end it all... because it is better to take time and heal within the relationship than outside of it because once outside the guarantee of getting back is quite low
30/10/2018, 14:21 - TJ Musiitwa: Given that okay to some people something like this is a high threshold for a reason to end it but for some there could be something that is even worse ana this is ideally something very low
30/10/2018, 14:22 - TJ Musiitwa: He should look at it long term and not short term as many of tend to see it..
30/10/2018, 14:22 - Liz: Yeah... Okay facts of the situation..  The Chic's were allegedly in bra's and  panties🤧
30/10/2018, 14:23 - Liz: I really talked to him but he said his lost it.  His lost all his trust and what not
30/10/2018, 14:25 - TJ Musiitwa: Well he should also ask himself that given that it was probably before the relationship and it does not count but 
If he too was out getting lapdances from someone's would be chic what effect does that have on the now
30/10/2018, 14:25 - TJ Musiitwa: Woah well OK when you present it like this....was this at a swimming pool or some sort of intimate setting?
30/10/2018, 14:26 - Liz: It was actually In there room.. Like on Friday night... They took alcohol with the boys and loud music and boom it happened...
30/10/2018, 14:27 - Liz: He said he could never do that🤷🏽‍♀...
30/10/2018, 14:28 - TJ Musiitwa: Either way it doesn't matter I think...it might be hard to give and let....but depends if really there was alot felt for the girl probably take some time to think about it...but if she wants the decision immediately then I would not blame him for going that decision
30/10/2018, 14:28 - TJ Musiitwa: The decision of just ending it
30/10/2018, 14:29 - TJ Musiitwa: With him there or not there?
And really with alcohol in the mix what did they expect would happen...stay sober and keep thinking clearly...
30/10/2018, 14:29 - TJ Musiitwa: Oh well good for him
30/10/2018, 14:30 - Liz: I felt like it was too irrational...
30/10/2018, 14:30 - Liz: Not there... He was home...
30/10/2018, 14:32 - TJ Musiitwa: On the part of the guy or the girl?
30/10/2018, 15:33 - Liz: The guy
30/10/2018, 17:49 - TJ Musiitwa: Well what would your advice be to counter his irrational belief?
30/10/2018, 18:54 - Liz: Don't break up
30/10/2018, 18:54 - Liz: But I already said I would break up
30/10/2018, 18:57 - TJ Musiitwa: So as you can see the situation is a dire one... The decision can be made one way.... However much the choice might be there to do it another which by all means is very minimal in terms of likelihood
30/10/2018, 18:58 - Liz: Yeap
30/10/2018, 19:08 - TJ Musiitwa: Were you friends with the girl or just the guy?
30/10/2018, 19:10 - Liz: Both
30/10/2018, 19:13 - TJ Musiitwa: Yikes
30/10/2018, 19:17 - Liz: Gene
30/10/2018, 19:22 - TJ Musiitwa: Not a good place to be
30/10/2018, 19:36 - Liz: U know right
30/10/2018, 19:40 - TJ Musiitwa: At this point best stay out of it... you said your words...now scoot out of it
30/10/2018, 19:42 - Liz: I'm trying.. But still
30/10/2018, 19:49 - TJ Musiitwa: But what?

30/10/2018, 22:04 - TJ Musiitwa: My dad sent me stuff to do and they are stuff like tests and stuff that frankly I thought I was done with for a long time....
30/10/2018, 22:05 - TJ Musiitwa: I am feeling a bit burned out.... could be because of the coding I have been doing....
30/10/2018, 22:05 - TJ Musiitwa: A friend came by to see me today had a good talk....
30/10/2018, 22:06 - TJ Musiitwa: Outside of the normal class environment really hard to see the people that I used to see alot.,...
30/10/2018, 22:06 - TJ Musiitwa: And overall feeling just blandly okay
30/10/2018, 22:07 - TJ Musiitwa: I mean what I am trying to do is taking long for sure but hey it's programming that's why I like it

14/11/2018, 21:50 - TJ Musiitwa: Now you would have the hard challenge of convincing me that  I need to choose you in different lifetimes....

14/11/2018, 21:59 - TJ Musiitwa: How so ,in a basic summary...if u don't mind me asking, if you are tired you don't have to answer...🙂
14/11/2018, 22:04 - Liz: Well u look at an article one by one then analyze it to the constitutional developments from 1900-1995..
14/11/2018, 22:05 - Liz: Everything is supposed to be connected to separation of powers.. Rule of law ..judicial independence bluh bluh
14/11/2018, 22:07 - TJ Musiitwa: So generally you are looking to analyse the differences, merits and demerits that various laws and acts in the agreement led to a supposed development of what the law today has been shaped into?
14/11/2018, 22:09 - Liz: Well not only that...there many events in the middle ur supposed to relate all this.. With cases and authorities e.g.. Article 6 of Buganda agreement conflicted with article 2 of the orders in council.. Give the case...Joseph what v something.  And explain ur things
14/11/2018, 22:10 - TJ Musiitwa: Wow the law...I couldn't do it...

15/11/2018, 22:14 - TJ Musiitwa: No surprise visits from Matt?😅
15/11/2018, 22:14 - Liz: 😄😄😄
15/11/2018, 22:14 - TJ Musiitwa: Or he also all up into revision for his own papers
15/11/2018, 22:17 - Liz: 🤭🤭 nahhhh
15/11/2018, 22:17 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha okay
15/11/2018, 22:18 - Liz: Did I tell u that his girlfriend is already jealous that we are besties🤷🏽‍♀🤷🏽‍♀🤷🏽‍♀🤷🏽‍♀
15/11/2018, 22:18 - Liz: Kale after me telling him not to break up with her
15/11/2018, 22:18 - Liz: Hmmm
15/11/2018, 22:18 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha no you didn't... Wait why she jealous...she insecure or something
15/11/2018, 22:19 - Liz: Yeah.. And he has things to do..like being with other friends... Not me
15/11/2018, 22:19 - TJ Musiitwa: Why did she do something bad or what?
15/11/2018, 22:19 - Liz: Yeahhhhh🙄...
15/11/2018, 22:19 - Liz: The lap dance thing I told u about
15/11/2018, 22:21 - TJ Musiitwa: Oh wait that was Matt's girl.... thought it was someone else
15/11/2018, 22:21 - TJ Musiitwa: Oh dang
15/11/2018, 22:21 - Liz: The only problem is we just be tight... Or he hangs out more with me than her🤷🏽‍♀... Or something like that...
15/11/2018, 22:21 - Liz: 🌚 right
15/11/2018, 22:22 - TJ Musiitwa: Okay well I can to an extent see how she might be understanding your friendly relationship with Matt if y'all hang out alot more than he does with her
15/11/2018, 22:23 - TJ Musiitwa: But still that's no reason to be all rash and be jealous about a friend who has been there before even you came into the picture...
15/11/2018, 22:24 - TJ Musiitwa: But hey it's still some feelings here and there about it all. She should just ask about it...then try to get some closure on it
15/11/2018, 22:25 - Liz: His problem is... He doesn't trust her and he feels its better to with someone who understands him..so I just be there with him.. 😊 just just...I'm sure he would do that for me
15/11/2018, 22:26 - TJ Musiitwa: Closure in that you and Matt will only ever be friends and just trust that...if she can't trust that...
Well let's just say that with that whole incident that happened, she's not really in the best place to say lack of trust and wat not
15/11/2018, 22:26 - TJ Musiitwa: I'm sure he would
15/11/2018, 22:26 - Liz: She asked.. He said it's because we are besties and she cannot Change it😮😮😮
15/11/2018, 22:28 - Liz: Right🤷🏽‍♀... And maybe her friends be throwing things in her head or something...
15/11/2018, 22:28 - Liz: That's the whole point.. So I can't chase him when he comes
15/11/2018, 22:29 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah well she should know that and find a way to re-earn that trust again... because really without it ... Well that is a relationship that is on weak footing
15/11/2018, 22:29 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha unfortunately as girls do
15/11/2018, 22:29 - TJ Musiitwa: Of course not
15/11/2018, 22:30 - Liz: I honestly don't know what will happen later in this r/ship.. I just hope it lasts...
15/11/2018, 22:31 - TJ Musiitwa: The sooner it improves the better🤞🏾🤞🏾
15/11/2018, 22:32 - Liz: But me I'm chill🤗🤗🤗🤗... I was told no more pleading for her next time he will just break up

15/11/2018, 22:35 - Liz: ❤❤
15/11/2018, 22:35 - TJ Musiitwa: Hey I'm doing some small research into something for a project I'm working on. Just need to know this
15/11/2018, 22:35 - TJ Musiitwa: What makes it hard or how easy is it to save money?
What do you think would make it easier to save?
If an application was made that allowed you to spend money but also automatically saved money for you towards say a certain goal would you use it?
15/11/2018, 22:36 - TJ Musiitwa: Also just help me with this small research I'm doing whenever you have time...
15/11/2018, 22:36 - Liz: I will
15/11/2018, 22:36 - Liz: Hihi
15/11/2018, 22:37 - Liz: Sure thing
15/11/2018, 22:37 - TJ Musiitwa: <Media omitted>
16/11/2018, 01:33 - Liz: Saving money is no guarantee that it will grow..rather u invest it cz I believe that money makes more money...u can try engaging in different projects be it small scale or big ones depending on yo capital.. Eg farming wc is safe cz if u invest in things like piggery u can just watch yo money grow per month..u can take it to a more risky level like business eg having a boutique... Depending on yo income.....u can also play it smart by starting from zero shillings to making a few dollars a week and more than enough a month( u can do this by engaging in cloud mining of cryptocurrencies on yo PC wc u can later sell for real money..) I believe that knowledge is power..can u believe that u can make a minimum of 10 dollars a day trading in forex and binary options? And this requires u to start with an initial capital investment of 50k...yes fifty thousands Ugandan shillings...
16/11/2018, 02:19 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha um who did you ask this.... talking about crypto and what not really😅
16/11/2018, 02:19 - TJ Musiitwa: Or who sent you this

Ectosymbiotic meaning that it lives on the outside of the hosts body
Neuroactive meaning that it affects parts of the brain
Obligate meaning that the symbiote requires the help of its host to survive
Mutualist mean that both host and symbiote get a mutual benefit from the relationship

09/12/2018, 13:14 - TJ Musiitwa: I wish I was there to go out with you as well....not much going on in my social life over here
09/12/2018, 14:31 - Liz: Everyone else was out
09/12/2018, 14:38 - TJ Musiitwa: So you didn't want to have FOMO
09/12/2018, 17:14 - Liz: Yeah
09/12/2018, 17:14 - Liz: But it was cool
09/12/2018, 18:04 - TJ Musiitwa: Good for you then
09/12/2018, 18:11 - Liz: And u
09/12/2018, 18:12 - Liz: How are we
09/12/2018, 18:15 - TJ Musiitwa: Well your boyfriend here is doing okay.
His social life is just normal.
He misses his girlfriend slot
Also I spent some time today looking for a good restaurant to take you out on for anniversary dinner date when I get back(hint hint get your black 👗 ready or if it is red no problemo)😁
09/12/2018, 18:16 - TJ Musiitwa: Also took the reading in church today, not a big deal🙃
09/12/2018, 18:18 - TJ Musiitwa: And on the other side, still dealing with how to do all that my dad is demanding of me it's getting much and much
09/12/2018, 18:19 - Liz: Well Ok... I hope they still fit me coz I've really  lost weight
09/12/2018, 18:19 - Liz: 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 wow cool
09/12/2018, 18:19 - Liz: Good for  u...  Its a big deal though
09/12/2018, 18:20 - Liz: For God and the congregation
09/12/2018, 18:21 - Liz: Much much?
09/12/2018, 18:22 - TJ Musiitwa: That's supposed to be a good thing lose weight then they will fit...or lose weight then they won't fit🤔
09/12/2018, 18:24 - TJ Musiitwa: I have an online course I am supposed to complete, then he wants that I do 2 standardized tests along with 1 language test and to get ready for all will take time and I think he expects that I should complete them all before I get back which I won't really have the time to do so
09/12/2018, 18:26 - Liz: But for  me they will be falling
09/12/2018, 18:27 - Liz: Woahhh... But u hv no option  right
09/12/2018, 18:30 - TJ Musiitwa: Oh okay so well good excuse to get a new dress then
09/12/2018, 18:30 - TJ Musiitwa: I am trying to argue against it we'll see where that ends up
09/12/2018, 18:33 - Liz: 🤗 hmmm
09/12/2018, 18:34 - Liz: I hope u guys come to a conclusion
09/12/2018, 18:38 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha yeah
09/12/2018, 18:39 - TJ Musiitwa: I hope so too because honestly ever have that feeling that you want to do something you have put off for so long for someone else then they ask you to do something and you try to atleast do what you can and get back to what you had previously been aiming for... that's what I am facing right now
09/12/2018, 18:40 - TJ Musiitwa: Honestly Elizabeth, I can't really talk to my dad and tell him all these things to him it might seem like I am not taking things seriously
09/12/2018, 18:44 - Liz: Yeap I understand  bcoz his the parent
09/12/2018, 18:46 - TJ Musiitwa: Exactly and we aren't really the Western kind of people, we African and children do not talk back to their elders
09/12/2018, 19:49 - Liz: But u can actually..  Just  bring it out in a humble way  that they can  understand
09/12/2018, 20:16 - TJ Musiitwa: Sometimes there are so many moving parts that to me I look at myself and see that I have done nothing wrong however, it seems as he is able to find just about anything that I seem to have done wrong
09/12/2018, 20:18 - Liz: 🙌🏽🙌🏽 Well IDK but I hope u can sort
09/12/2018, 20:18 - TJ Musiitwa: I don't like talking bad about my dad, he has sacrificed alot for me, alot and I think to me I guess that sacrifice is like a weight over my head that just lets me know that I have nothing to complain about what have I given back in return so ideally it's like I have no bargain power whatsoever
09/12/2018, 20:55 - TJ Musiitwa: I hope so too
09/12/2018, 21:38 - TJ Musiitwa: Goodnight Elizabeth
10/12/2018, 13:20 - TJ Musiitwa: Hey good afternoon darling, just got up?

31/12/2018, 19:04 - Liz: Now I'm continuing my recap
31/12/2018, 19:05 - TJ Musiitwa: HAPPY NEW YEAR
It's again that time of the year where we are to close off the old year and step into the new one. 2018 has been a year with so much that it has brought for us, both good and bad, however it's a year of experiences learned, friends made and lost, and all in all greater love felt(in my opinion)

Slight recap of the year that has been; Got to spend some part of it in Uganda with you for our 2nd anniversary, that was awesome. It was good to be home. I am happy that while it might not be on the actual day and that you are still busy that week at least I'll be there for our 3rd. Then it was the beginning of my 3rd year as well as your got into law school and you worked hard to get that. I was happy for you.
Then your birthday, the surprise on your face when you got the phone, I am glad I still have that video, I look at it to just see you smile constantly also your speechlessness. Then you started showing us what your photo prowess could be with a new phone and glad to say you have not disappointed 😅

 it was the year where really I had been tested and pushed the hardest, going through my final year project and all the ups and downs that came with it, the disappointments, the struggles, the let downs, a trying time for me(sure there are people who been through worse) depressed, started getting into Red bull...wow what a time but finally I was done.

In the year ahead we can look forward to a  few things:  you come through the 1st year of University and as I hope to find a master's school soon and be able to work to the success of my projects, my graduation, your big 20th birthday, our 3 year anniversary, to mention but a few of what is yet to come...365 days to find out what to make of the year

And so as we look forward to the new year ahead and all that it has for us in our respective perspectives, it's my hope that we continue to learn, grow, experience and keep trying (something that seems to be a weakness for me). I hope for myself to become a better version of myself in the new year and to be ready to face new challenges and hope to succeed. I in the same faith want to wish the same for you as you work your way through law school, and certainly there is alot more that you hope for yourself I am sure. I hope you achieve all that and more.

Cheers to a new year and cheers to us 
God bless you, us and everyone and everything we love and hold dear.
I love you
Jonathan

14/01/2019, 07:24 - TJ Musiitwa: Happy anniversary to ToRia❤
14/01/2019, 07:28 - TJ Musiitwa: 🧡
We have done it again baby, we have reached the 3 years of our relationship and as with the culmination of any year an anniversary to celebrate what was and what is meant to come moving forward.
💛
Year 2 has been one in which we have had lots to experience.. with changes both outside our relationship and within it. 
💚
Although this was the year that we had our 1st big disagreement and where it was over something so simple, it was arguably my fault and for that as I have before, I apologise. However I have seen that as a learning experience for me to try to avoid that side of myself.
💙
It has been a positive year of learning of self growth, you have become ever more bolder, ever more beautiful and I believe ever more blessed. I want and wish all that and more in this new year. I hope to continue my very best to appreciate you and love you and support you and become hopefully a better person in myself both for you and also for I.
🖤	
Thank you for your continued support of me and the listening and the advice and your memes (your meme game has been strong this year😅) and your laughter, your smiles and ever more importantly your love and trust of me. I continue to appreciate it so very much.
💜
I hope that for the year going  forward we continue to be blessed that we continue to fight for us, to make this work, to love and commit to us as we have been the past 2 years
	
I love you and happy anniversary my love
With Love,
Jonathan

05/03/2019, 00:25 - Liz: 😂😂😂😂 what
05/03/2019, 00:25 - Liz: Too much determination
05/03/2019, 00:25 - TJ Musiitwa: Exactly
05/03/2019, 00:26 - Liz: Any who I don't know if I really want to get married ASAP...
05/03/2019, 00:29 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha I get you still have time ahead to decide appropriately....or maybe I have to decide....
05/03/2019, 00:29 - TJ Musiitwa: Asap doesn't me like fresh out of LDC.... woah
05/03/2019, 00:31 - Liz: I just thought through and eehh with marriage I'll not do many things I want to do😪
05/03/2019, 00:31 - TJ Musiitwa: Like what...
05/03/2019, 00:31 - Liz: I don't think so
05/03/2019, 00:32 - TJ Musiitwa: What can you not do in marriage that outside of it isn't possible
05/03/2019, 00:32 - TJ Musiitwa: Well I mean apart from go out and heck even sleeping with someone you aren't attached to
05/03/2019, 00:32 - TJ Musiitwa: Talk to me I wish to know
05/03/2019, 00:35 - Liz: 🧐😂😂 I don't think I would want to leave my family to pursue other studies...it would be hard...children... Bluh bluh.. 
 I would want to do many things without being attached to people I might end up hurting them or myself
05/03/2019, 00:36 - TJ Musiitwa: But who said that immediately wedding is done, children have to come next.... no
05/03/2019, 00:37 - Liz: 😂😂😂 eeehhh don't over react
05/03/2019, 00:37 - TJ Musiitwa: haha I am not....I am just emotioning
05/03/2019, 00:38 - TJ Musiitwa: Listen you know me well, I have told you before I would like to support you and your career as much as possible
05/03/2019, 00:38 - TJ Musiitwa: But the thing to remember is that in a marriage it's 2 people always trying to make it work
05/03/2019, 00:39 - TJ Musiitwa: I have a friend who's mom went to pursue her master's or PhD abroad...left the children home with the dad....
05/03/2019, 00:39 - TJ Musiitwa: She came back successful...life went on
05/03/2019, 00:40 - TJ Musiitwa: Besides I think it should always be a smart decision when the thought of having children comes about, being sensible about it is the adult way to do it
05/03/2019, 00:41 - TJ Musiitwa: Responsible way to do it
05/03/2019, 00:42 - TJ Musiitwa: If it means probably you need to work abroad we try and make it work
05/03/2019, 00:43 - Liz: I don't know😊 we shall see when we get there but oh well I'm just saying
05/03/2019, 00:45 - TJ Musiitwa: But in all I understand the concerns you have... I hope that for you as you grow older and wiser, all these concerns, you will be able to tackle them
05/03/2019, 00:45 - TJ Musiitwa: And you'll come out infront able to make it all work
05/03/2019, 00:46 - TJ Musiitwa: Btw I hope I am not keeping you awake with a possible early morning class possibly calling
05/03/2019, 00:48 - Liz: I'm used..I'll  even HV to wake up to read cases
05/03/2019, 00:49 - Liz: Im actually still thinking... I just want to be sure I won't hurt people and stuff like that
05/03/2019, 00:50 - TJ Musiitwa: You don't disturb Ashley by keeping the lights on....gosh honestly if it was me I would hate it if my roommate did that....
05/03/2019, 00:51 - TJ Musiitwa: You have a long time to think... take all the long time you need but not too long😅

10/03/2019, 18:21 - Liz: <Media omitted>

10/03/2019, 18:29 - TJ Musiitwa: 😍😍😍
10/03/2019, 18:29 - TJ Musiitwa: Stunning

11/03/2019, 00:11 - Liz: 😂😂 I'm just giving them a chance to be happy
11/03/2019, 00:40 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha
11/03/2019, 00:55 - Liz: BTW Ashley's fon was stolen so sometimes she will use mine..and it shows I'm online yet it her using mine
11/03/2019, 00:55 - Liz: Don't tell Livia yet
11/03/2019, 00:55 - Liz: 😩
11/03/2019, 01:11 - TJ Musiitwa: Okay
11/03/2019, 01:12 - TJ Musiitwa: Oh damn that sucks.... how was it taken
11/03/2019, 01:13 - Liz: From her boyfriend .Trevor😪 on Friday as they had gone out
11/03/2019, 01:13 - Liz: Please don't
11/03/2019, 01:14 - TJ Musiitwa: Dang.... That was surely a phone that was sure to be stolen but if it can't be unlocked then it's useless
11/03/2019, 01:15 - TJ Musiitwa: Has Ashely tried using find my phone feature?
11/03/2019, 01:15 - TJ Musiitwa: Most iPhones have that
11/03/2019, 01:15 - TJ Musiitwa: I won't
11/03/2019, 01:17 - TJ Musiitwa: Or at least has she tried to like remote lock the phone maybe erase so that it becomes useless to whoever stole jt
11/03/2019, 01:18 - Liz: Nop.. Idk she hasn't really done anything about it...Trevor is trying to track it or something but it actually rings
11/03/2019, 01:18 - TJ Musiitwa: Doesn't show anything like a location?
11/03/2019, 01:19 - Liz: Now its off but it was ringing since yesterday
11/03/2019, 01:19 - Liz: Bambi she's very sad
11/03/2019, 01:20 - Liz: I don't know😪 I didn't want to be too inside their jazz.. So I didn't ask really
11/03/2019, 01:21 - TJ Musiitwa: Otherwise if that's the case then the only thing to do is remote erase the phone... becomes useless to whoever stole it but ultimately it means that if she actually finds it then it also becomes useless to her too
11/03/2019, 01:21 - TJ Musiitwa: Oh okay I understand
11/03/2019, 01:21 - TJ Musiitwa: I would be too I'm sure it was expensive
11/03/2019, 01:22 - Liz: Eeehhh that's not a good thing right
11/03/2019, 01:22 - Liz: Yes her best fon
11/03/2019, 01:23 - TJ Musiitwa: But it also means that whoever has it also doesn't get the benefit of enjoying it so really it is like tit for tat
11/03/2019, 01:25 - Liz: Okay just pray to God it appears
11/03/2019, 01:25 - Liz: I'm dozing now good night hun

I was curious and please take some time and put some real thought into this before you answer.

Could you let me know of anything that I have done for you, said to you..told you over and over before over our 3 years that I stopped telling you or saying to you, that you wish I could resume.

Please and thank you.
PS I am not perfect....so don't tell me that there's nothing at all...🙂

Oh

01/04/2019, 11:51 - TJ Musiitwa: Man trips to kisubi  and stuff....good thing the stuff I forgot were minor like a pillow or something like that

01/04/2019, 22:43 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha I gave you that 10k....you ate it...not my problem😅😅
01/04/2019, 22:43 - TJ Musiitwa: Also unfortunate that we are different networks
01/04/2019, 22:44 - Liz: 🌚 10k doesn't buy airtime
01/04/2019, 22:44 - Liz: It only buys 1gb for only a week
01/04/2019, 22:44 - Liz: Hmmm
01/04/2019, 22:44 - TJ Musiitwa: Or buys 3gb for 1month on Africell
01/04/2019, 22:46 - Liz: Not enough
01/04/2019, 22:46 - TJ Musiitwa: Seriously 3GB isn't enough for social bundles....
01/04/2019, 22:47 - TJ Musiitwa: How much data do you use when you only check WhatsApp...
01/04/2019, 22:47 - TJ Musiitwa: Last time on IG? Or Facebook....
01/04/2019, 22:48 - TJ Musiitwa: 3GB should be more than enough for a month
01/04/2019, 22:53 - Liz: I check WhatsApp and my cases are online
01/04/2019, 22:53 - Liz: Social bundle isn't cool
01/04/2019, 22:53 - Liz: 😂 no
01/04/2019, 22:59 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha maybe not you... but for me....I am going to need them .... quite a bit
01/04/2019, 22:59 - TJ Musiitwa: Social bundles.... really
01/04/2019, 23:00 - TJ Musiitwa: Unless you check all the socials...do.you have accounts on all
01/04/2019, 23:01 - Liz: I use real data to search my cases so I don't use social bundles
01/04/2019, 23:02 - Liz: Not effective for me
01/04/2019, 23:04 - TJ Musiitwa: Ahh maybe that
01/04/2019, 23:05 - TJ Musiitwa: ??
01/04/2019, 23:05 - Liz: It was okay.. Normal
01/04/2019, 23:05 - Liz: Yes
01/04/2019, 23:07 - TJ Musiitwa: Nothing exciting
01/04/2019, 23:09 - Liz: Mentorship class

02/04/2019, 15:50 - Liz: Next week is coursework week
02/04/2019, 15:50 - TJ Musiitwa: What time should I come...
02/04/2019, 15:51 - TJ Musiitwa: Because you know those after class hours is usually when my mom decides she wants to leave so it's a bit hard
02/04/2019, 15:51 - TJ Musiitwa: Then
02/04/2019, 15:51 - TJ Musiitwa: Ahh so next week off bounds...

03/04/2019, 12:04 - Liz: These guys are still using the room🤷🏽‍♀..Ashley
03/04/2019, 12:04 - TJ Musiitwa: Haha okay well you tell me when
03/04/2019, 12:09 - Liz: Sure
03/04/2019, 12:49 - Liz: Okay...
03/04/2019, 12:50 - TJ Musiitwa: Come now...
03/04/2019, 12:50 - Liz: I'm in my room with Ashley
03/04/2019, 12:50 - TJ Musiitwa: Okay coming
03/04/2019, 20:02 - TJ Musiitwa: Hey I forgot to ask you a question because I would have liked to have gotten a response and seen your face as you said it
03/04/2019, 20:03 - TJ Musiitwa: Honestly, do you think we have been distant abit...or is it just me thinking that
03/04/2019, 20:45 - Liz: Yes yes  we have,.
03/04/2019, 21:38 - TJ Musiitwa: Is there anything we can do about it...
03/04/2019, 21:38 - TJ Musiitwa: To bridge this distance
03/04/2019, 21:40 - TJ Musiitwa: Because I am glad that I am not the only one noticing this.... maybe it is because of the busy schedules and all that
03/04/2019, 22:24 - Liz: Do you HV any ideas because really I don't?
03/04/2019, 22:38 - TJ Musiitwa: Well I am not sure but I guess we could start with small things and hopefully the bigger stuff will take care of themselves gradually
03/04/2019, 22:39 - TJ Musiitwa: A simple idea would be maybe to do a simple status once in a while...
03/04/2019, 22:39 - TJ Musiitwa: I will admit I have not done that in a while and I apologize
03/04/2019, 22:39 - TJ Musiitwa: Then maybe we go from there
03/04/2019, 22:41 - TJ Musiitwa: But I know because of the busy time ahead it might be abit harder to talk more but maybe we can try
03/04/2019, 22:41 - TJ Musiitwa: Dedicate some time for the two of us to just talk about stuff to each other...
03/04/2019, 22:42 - TJ Musiitwa: I could be curious about something in life.....you would maybe want to know about how to I don't know help a friend in a certain situation something like that
03/04/2019, 22:42 - TJ Musiitwa: I think
03/04/2019, 22:42 - TJ Musiitwa: Something like that would I think be a good way to start
03/04/2019, 22:42 - TJ Musiitwa: Your opinions or any other suggestions?
03/04/2019, 22:44 - Liz: Okay maybe but can I say I feel too busy for the relationship its really most of my fault and I don't see myself creating time so basically I'm letting myself down and I don't want to do anything about it 😪
03/04/2019, 22:52 - TJ Musiitwa: You don't want to do anything about the parting distance or about letting yourself down without the much involvement in the relationship?
03/04/2019, 22:53 - TJ Musiitwa: I too acknowledge that the busy schedule is quite a major factor.
03/04/2019, 22:54 - TJ Musiitwa: But maybe with some baby steps we can maybe come back to center.
03/04/2019, 22:58 - Liz: Yes and  it's not going to change as much..
 Maybe I'm trying to deal with you being in the country wch i m failing at... Or something...
 But lemme give it a break..  I really need it like honestly no lies. I just need a break from everything... Sometimes I even feel stressed by all the other things and I just feel like I can't even go on and its just all the depression I've collected from way back..
03/04/2019, 23:07 - TJ Musiitwa: I am sorry that you feel stressed by everything going on around you. I don't know what I can do to help relieve that stress if there's something please do tell. And depression is a serious thing, I know how you feel it can dull your mood and all that around you. So just remember that I am here to talk to if you ever need to.

When I was far, we felt close. Now that I am near we feel far.
So does ours work the greater the distance?

So you need a break from the relationship from us or is it something else entirely?
03/04/2019, 23:13 - Liz: Thank you thank you.   I know I feel stressed by everything I hope I go through this anyway.

03/04/2019, 23:18 - TJ Musiitwa: To love someone is to continue to  be there for them even beyond and especially when it's a time that they feel down. To not be selfish is to have the best love.

17/04/2019, 14:35 - TJ Musiitwa: I do not see how that is reducing that would be increasing.... because slaughtering a man and murdering them...well sound to be 2 different levels of killing...the former being worse
17/04/2019, 14:37 - TJ Musiitwa: And here I was about to inquire and be like so you are presenting how to provoce oneself to being dense.... like as in

04/05/2019, 00:42 - TJ Musiitwa: Where I can actually get you talking it's against your nature I understand but communication in our relationship is something that would very much help
04/05/2019, 00:43 - Liz: I don't think we shall .

04/05/2019, 05:18 - Liz: Right
08/05/2019, 00:37 - TJ Musiitwa: Each time I get to see you I am amazed that my heart can continue to flutter and somewhere somehow my mood takes a turn despite everything that's going on.

13/06/2019, 16:03 - Liz: Its true to some extent but nope no one is willing to do that.. *no one*.

So what happens if she's rejected
13/06/2019, 16:05 - TJ Musiitwa: Boys just want to kiss girls... it's a thing.
However girls think about the likelihood and impact of it and what comes before and after
It's a lot more decisive on their part....
Guys will just want to do it

 You still don't want to talk about it
16/06/2019, 21:42 - TJ Musiitwa: Preferably in person...

16/06/2019, 21:49 - TJ Musiitwa: You must understand I will feel better only if you listen to me in person
16/06/2019, 22:12 - Liz: I'll still listen even if not in person
16/06/2019, 22:12 - Liz: Do you know how anxious I am to know
16/06/2019, 22:14 - TJ Musiitwa: I am certain you are
16/06/2019, 22:15 - Liz: Soooo?
16/06/2019, 22:16 - TJ Musiitwa: And I am sorry but it's my stubborn self....and I don't have a stubborn side but it just has to be in person
16/06/2019, 22:17 - Liz: Why👀
16/06/2019, 22:18 - TJ Musiitwa: Among the reasons because well it's been a while since I saw you...that and other reasons
16/06/2019, 22:20 - Liz: You also saw me at church today
16/06/2019, 22:21 - Liz: Unha?

16/06/2019, 22:36 - Liz: ?
16/06/2019, 23:09 - TJ Musiitwa: By seeing I meant in the context of actually sitting down to talk and all
16/06/2019, 23:10 - TJ Musiitwa: If you say this it's like saying a picture of you means that I saw you
17/06/2019, 00:18 - Liz: Oo
17/06/2019, 00:18 - Liz: Okay
17/06/2019, 00:18 - Liz: we will get through it

21/06/2019, 16:18 - Liz: I failed to  dance shaku shaku
21/06/2019, 18:56 - Liz: These are the only non slow songs you have😵😵
21/06/2019, 18:56 - Liz: ??
21/06/2019, 19:31 - TJ Musiitwa: Yes
21/06/2019, 19:32 - TJ Musiitwa: I like listening to music that reflects what I am feeling...as those tend to have great lyrics
21/06/2019, 19:33 - Liz: 🤗 but they are dancing songs?
21/06/2019, 19:34 - TJ Musiitwa: Not all dancing... some are just songs
21/06/2019, 19:34 - TJ Musiitwa: To listen to....
To sing to
21/06/2019, 19:44 - Liz: Okay may be that
21/06/2019, 23:02 - Liz: So mpozi why did you break up with me
21/06/2019, 23:02 - Liz: 🌚
22/06/2019, 01:33 - TJ Musiitwa: Because it was best for us both, given that you had us on this long break with no end of it in sight.
So I made the decision to make it simpler for you
22/06/2019, 01:35 - TJ Musiitwa: That and I was  trying to get the communication aspect of our relationship working but failing
22/06/2019, 01:35 - TJ Musiitwa: Also we just didn't have the spark that we used to have
22/06/2019, 01:38 - Liz: Ohhhhh okay.
22/06/2019, 01:39 - TJ Musiitwa: You concur that it was for the best too?
22/06/2019, 01:40 - Liz: This time I was thinking I would still have what to say😅 but my words have betrayed me again😅
22/06/2019, 01:41 - Liz: No wait🌚
22/06/2019, 01:41 - Liz: Those were the only 3reasons
22/06/2019, 01:45 - TJ Musiitwa: The 3 reasons but that build upon each other
22/06/2019, 01:45 - TJ Musiitwa: From the bottom up, alot of thinking led me to that
22/06/2019, 01:46 - Liz: Only 3
22/06/2019, 01:50 - TJ Musiitwa: Why you expected there to be way more
22/06/2019, 01:50 - TJ Musiitwa: Three reasons don't satisfy you enough?
22/06/2019, 01:52 - Liz: Yes🤷🏽‍♀ three . 1.2.3🌚
22/06/2019, 01:53 - TJ Musiitwa: Well I stand by my 3 reasons because they cover largely the most pressing issues that led to the decision
22/06/2019, 01:55 - TJ Musiitwa: I'll take off for the night, maybe you will have what to say in the morning
22/06/2019, 01:55 - Liz: No no no
22/06/2019, 01:56 - Liz: I want to finish this🤗 
If I over think about it i just be sad..  What I'm avoiding now
22/06/2019, 01:57 - TJ Musiitwa: Well I am waiting to read what you have to type
22/06/2019, 01:59 - Liz: I don't know how to argue about peoples feelings🤗 but its okay.. Its your decision🌚
 

    Also I didn't See this one coming😅 but oh well..
22/06/2019, 02:00 - Liz: 😂😂 oh my God I'm so bad at this😂😂
22/06/2019, 02:01 - Liz: Jessie's status😵😵😵
22/06/2019, 02:01 - Liz: His woman😵😵😵😵😵
22/06/2019, 02:01 - Liz: Wow
22/06/2019, 02:05 - TJ Musiitwa: You think...🙂
I am maybe too overgrown per se because of the seriousness I put into the relationship with the emotions and everything. 
Probably something you could not do 
But it will be good to take time to grow up and learn. As I mentioned I probably tried to grow you up quickly when that just wasn't you.

2ndly saying you didn't see it coming, I think you weren't keenly observing the relationship...if you didn't see the tale-tale signs... then I am curious if what was in the past 3 years is your version of what was now
22/06/2019, 02:06 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah saw that yesterday.
You can now be anyone's woman
22/06/2019, 02:07 - Liz: 😂😂 oh lord😂😂 😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵
22/06/2019, 02:08 - Liz: I just can't
22/06/2019, 02:13 - Liz: Yes yes.. 
 I got you🙂 
  Unfortunately I don't have the previous years chats to see..
And its the best decision you made😅 
 Lemme just not stress you with my law books😁  
 I hope you become happier😉
22/06/2019, 02:14 - TJ Musiitwa: I hope you get happier in your own way too
22/06/2019, 02:15 - TJ Musiitwa: Now can I get some shut eye please?
Or is there more?
22/06/2019, 02:17 - Liz: 😅 the more doesn't matter now😹 
 *But* we aren't xz🌚 we are friends
22/06/2019, 02:17 - Liz: 🌚🌚
22/06/2019, 02:18 - Liz: Don't worry😅 
 I've got this🙂
22/06/2019, 02:18 - TJ Musiitwa: Ok
22/06/2019, 02:19 - TJ Musiitwa: 😴😴😴
22/06/2019, 02:19 - Liz: 👍🏽

01/07/2019, 11:11 - Liz: <Media omitted>
01/07/2019, 11:11 - Liz: Hey
01/07/2019, 14:02 - TJ Musiitwa: Cousins be like
01/07/2019, 14:04 - Liz: Yiii
01/07/2019, 14:05 - Liz: I don't have the same initials with my  cousins🌚😹
01/07/2019, 14:05 - Liz: Or maybe we aren't cousins
01/07/2019, 14:07 - TJ Musiitwa: Yup you aren't cousins
01/07/2019, 14:10 - Liz: 🌚 we are
01/07/2019, 14:10 - Liz: you and Livia don't have same initials🌚
01/07/2019, 14:10 - Liz: So you aren't siblings?
01/07/2019, 15:51 - TJ Musiitwa: We are blood .... different...
01/07/2019, 16:41 - Liz: 🌚 cousins aren't blood?
02/07/2019, 00:30 - Liz: Why do I feel like you aren't happy with me or anyone
02/07/2019, 00:30 - Liz: ???
02/07/2019, 00:31 - Liz: Are you fine?
02/07/2019, 00:43 - TJ Musiitwa: I'll be blunt. Of course I couldn't be happy with you because of the whole breakup thing...yes I dealt with it but I am also still trying to get in the right sense of mind.
Other than that.... it's just all my plans and ideas and alot of thinking that I am doing constantly.
And more to that it's that I don't feel like I got a strong friend circle per-se it's there but just isn't.
Putting time into people who don't reciprocate it.... when someone asked me what happened before I mentioned _the world happened_, yeah that....

But all that said trying to do me so maybe yes I am fine
02/07/2019, 00:44 - Liz: See I knew you weren't fine
02/07/2019, 00:48 - Liz: <Media omitted>
02/07/2019, 00:48 - Liz: Right sense of mind?
02/07/2019, 00:49 - Liz: Maybe your friends are just busy or maybe the whole abroad thing. They are still dealing with you being around🤷🏽‍♀
02/07/2019, 00:50 - Liz: 🙄🙄 you aren't fine. Maybe physically
02/07/2019, 00:53 - TJ Musiitwa: Well I will deal with me... with the help of the few close friends and fam I got... along with the serenity of the Holy Spirit. 
I'll deal with me
02/07/2019, 00:56 - TJ Musiitwa: You are already happy. Great for you. It's just my whirlwind of emotions and lots of thinking about that has me this way. But I'm a growing person, I'll deal with myself and be back to what I think is the normal you expect from me
02/07/2019, 00:56 - TJ Musiitwa: 🙂
02/07/2019, 00:57 - TJ Musiitwa: For now got some late night work to get started on.
02/07/2019, 00:57 - TJ Musiitwa: Laters.
02/07/2019, 01:06 - Liz: 😳😂 wow...Wow.  Wow..
 Since you broke up with me I have avoided all ways of thinking about it...
Well sometimes it comes   but then I remember I didn't make this decision for myself and I let go.
And with all this I've been sick and busying myself of course no one will realize because apparently I'm good at covering up and people don't really care.. 
So maybe if you think I'm happy thats what everyone thinks🙂 🤷🏽‍♀ and ohhh its okay
02/07/2019, 01:11 - Liz: 🌚 I don't know if you even think we are friends Or anything.
But I want you to know.. I got your back🙂 just in case you want to talk..I'll listen
02/07/2019, 01:11 - Liz: This so much reminds me of law school😓
02/07/2019, 06:53 - TJ Musiitwa: Much appreciated
02/07/2019, 06:55 - TJ Musiitwa: And then I ended up sleeping because full belly and early wake up and lots of driving...
Gosh why did I even spend on the night shift bundle
02/07/2019, 10:53 - Liz: ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
02/07/2019, 10:53 - Liz: Anytime
02/07/2019, 10:54 - Liz: 😂 coz you thought you were going to do some work
02/07/2019, 15:50 - TJ Musiitwa: Big regret
02/07/2019, 18:29 - Liz: You shall be fine
03/07/2019, 20:09 - TJ Musiitwa: Btw question...what does it or would it mean for me if I wanted to grant temporary control of a company I built to say a co-founder or subsidiary for the time being and then come back and reclaim the control....
Is it something to do with power of attorney or something like that or is it something else?
03/07/2019, 20:59 - Liz: Lemme first research
03/07/2019, 21:58 - Liz: This is quite vague. As a Co founder with no other position in the company, you remain a promoter and your duties towards the company are fiduciary
03/07/2019, 21:58 - Liz: So is the person a director in the company or in any other management position?
03/07/2019, 22:43 - TJ Musiitwa: The co founder has another role as a CFO,so in the legal aspects does it still remain power of attorney or something else
03/07/2019, 22:49 - Liz: What should I say here?
03/07/2019, 22:49 - TJ Musiitwa: This
03/07/2019, 22:49 - Liz: But this is company law I've not really studied it but can I give you Kenneth Kiapi's contact
03/07/2019, 22:50 - Liz: his the one I actually asked
03/07/2019, 22:56 - TJ Musiitwa: It's alright I'll contact my cousin
03/07/2019, 23:08 - Liz: Mary Justine?
03/07/2019, 23:08 - Liz: You need to contact someone who has studied company law wch is in third year
03/07/2019, 23:15 - Liz: Well I'm not sure about their articles and memorandum of association, but if he has the power as CEO he can just appoint someone to act as CEO until his return
04/07/2019, 07:02 - TJ Musiitwa: Nope I got another cousin my dad's side who is also a lawyer
04/07/2019, 07:10 - Liz: Alright good luck
04/07/2019, 07:59 - Liz: Control can simply be by way of making them director on specific terms depending on what one's MEMARTS allow... But a power of attorney also seems appropriate... And safer... Because that power, if properly executed, must be followed to dot by the donee.
06/07/2019, 14:38 - TJ Musiitwa: Gotta say you looked good yesterday.
So you've been pulling out all the major hitters recently🙂
06/07/2019, 21:48 - Liz: 😂😂😂😂yiiiiiiii
06/07/2019, 21:48 - Liz: Noo
06/07/2019, 21:48 - Liz: I just happen to be out of law school... 
Thats what's causing it
06/07/2019, 23:37 - TJ Musiitwa: What stops you wearing them in law school
06/07/2019, 23:40 - Liz: 😵😵😵😵

07/07/2019, 17:22 - Liz: I still have your dish meanwhile🙈🙈👩 shall tell "TJ" to return it...with a something inside...for us they brought us up well...we are not supposed to return dishes that were given to us with food back empty😁😁
07/07/2019, 19:28 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah I had always been meaning to bring it back with something inside but well exams, one thing after the other, and then what happened...but if she wants me to return it with something inside I will
07/07/2019, 20:12 - Liz: Livia

 So I got a question, if a solution was to come up where there was a service being offered to allow you buy food that would otherwise be wasted but at half price, would you buy it,
Say food that is perishable and has to be eaten that day...like from supermarket food sections, restaurants, bakeries?
Would you be open to that or is there something that would hold you back....?
31/07/2019, 14:21 - Liz: I would be open to that
31/07/2019, 14:22 - TJ Musiitwa: 👍🏾

20/08/2019, 20:23 - Liz: Well yeah.  I just got emotional today and I was like well I'm too blessed
24/08/2019, 22:52 - Liz: 🤔
25/08/2019, 01:14 - TJ Musiitwa: Yes please...
25/08/2019, 01:58 - TJ Musiitwa: Rummaging through my notebook and I stumbled upon one of these this among others

" _Some of the toughest things in the world are to really want someone and not have them around you. These are the times when you don't know what to do but all you can do is wait_ ◉‿◉ 
I'll miss you"
25/08/2019, 01:58 - TJ Musiitwa: Your words to me... Don't know if you remember them...
25/08/2019, 01:58 - TJ Musiitwa: 🙂
25/08/2019, 10:18 - Liz: I do
25/08/2019, 10:19 - Liz: So now why are you sad
25/08/2019, 10:46 - TJ Musiitwa: What says I am sad?
25/08/2019, 10:59 - TJ Musiitwa: But honestly, I have been thinking alot about something recently and I am still weighing the options that are coming along with it....
25/08/2019, 12:32 - Liz: The emoji
25/08/2019, 12:33 - Liz: You can share here if you don't mind
25/08/2019, 15:42 - TJ Musiitwa: 🙂 this is a sad face emoji... Not  this...🙁

🤔
25/08/2019, 15:43 - TJ Musiitwa: Ummmm .....
25/08/2019, 16:02 - Liz: 🌚 its cool
26/08/2019, 20:06 - TJ Musiitwa: Good evening, so I decided that well I might as well tell you what's going on in my head. Truth be told it's about you and well I might as well be wearing my heart on my sleeve.

Given that you know me, I actually would have preferred to say this in person but oh well...
I honestly still harbor feelings for you. Maybe you were waiting for me to tell you...and all....but yeah that's that. And it has been chewing on my inside for a while but that the thing that's giving me a conflict of emotions is given my current position. 
Right now I am trying to work on myself and get something that I am dedicated to up and running. And as such my thought is that well(from my perspective, that I'd like to become abit more successful than I am now, before I attempt to come back to you). That's another can of worms right there, *IF* you will take me back. If it's a positive, then well I am glad, however if it's a negative, then that's okay as well, I'll trust that it's for the better.

Either way I feel like maybe right now, while there's a lot I would've liked to do for you, I can't right now but maybe when it all comes to pass I might.

As mentioned a conflict of emotions and so why I wrote this message to just at least get it off my chest... because at least now you know what is going on and I can be content knowing I told you. 

However you interpret or decide, I will be alright.
So that's that.
26/08/2019, 20:08 - TJ Musiitwa: Anyway, Hope you had a better day and this message doesn't put you down
26/08/2019, 23:39 - Liz: Hi..
I've read this message three times over and I just don't get it.. I really don't understand why you actually broke up with me in the first place.. I just don't get it..
26/08/2019, 23:39 - Liz: I don't know *if* I'll take you back... It's not as easy as it is.. How will I know that you won't even hurt me again immediately after my birthday😔 I was so hurt BTW...
26/08/2019, 23:39 - Liz: I don't think I know you anymore as much as I thought I knew you and I even thought you didn't want anything to do with me again so literally
27/08/2019, 00:06 - TJ Musiitwa: Well to explain it was the communication that was lacking. I believe I had explained that much... I tried as much to get you to talk to me and all that was not possible.
27/08/2019, 00:07 - TJ Musiitwa: I understand. I can be at peace now
27/08/2019, 00:09 - Liz: 🌚 then you gave up
27/08/2019, 00:09 - Liz: ???
27/08/2019, 00:10 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah well I guess I did really change, even I know am not that the same old me...
27/08/2019, 00:12 - Liz: Maybe you don't actually like me as much as I think or you think... 
However much I might want to go back.. I really don't know
27/08/2019, 00:17 - TJ Musiitwa: I did really try to be patient and tried to maybe see how I could help....I continuously asked, I am sure you can recall....
If I didn't try hard enough, harder than I already was.... well I am sorry
27/08/2019, 00:21 - TJ Musiitwa: You have no idea how much I really did like you...when I do love I love hard and really do commit to it....

But hey you have said your peace...and made it clear. I will move on now....my conflicted feelings are now calm and know their place. All the best for you
27/08/2019, 00:23 - TJ Musiitwa: Sorry that we, I couldn't make it work
27/08/2019, 00:23 - Liz: 🌚 I said I don't know.. I didn't say i can't go back
27/08/2019, 00:31 - Liz: I'm sorry I didn't see how much effort you put too it was my fault BTW but i just didn't think it would end up breaking you.. I'm really sorry for anything😔
 I'll just try to better myself and my communication during all this.. As you focus on whatever you are really trying to do.. I don't really think I have the right words for this conversation am even almost dozing but if everything allows maybe in the future when the time is right we might as well just see what happens i honestly  don't know. This all came as a shocker.. I honestly honestly honestly didn't think you actually even thought about me and I tried to get over that
27/08/2019, 00:33 - Liz: Well we tried😊and  I don't regret the three years we spent together.
It's all God's grace
27/08/2019, 00:41 - TJ Musiitwa: There's nothing wrong other than communication....I valued that alot.... maybe your next guy might value something different...
Either way, yeah not the right time to have such a conversation.
Well let's see what the future holds
27/08/2019, 00:41 - TJ Musiitwa: Yeah the messages....still do have them starred... really were some memories...
27/08/2019, 00:42 - TJ Musiitwa: Goodnight to you
27/08/2019, 00:50 - Liz: Not the right time.. Really I'm so exhausted I can't even think straight.. 
But I know that you actually hurt me and I'm getting over it..
27/08/2019, 00:50 - Liz: Can we post pone this I'm dying😭😭
27/08/2019, 00:51 - Liz: Which messages
27/08/2019, 00:51 - TJ Musiitwa: Naah it's done we are okay...get some sleep...I don't want to bring this up again...
27/08/2019, 00:52 - TJ Musiitwa: Lots of messages, birthday messages, anniversary etc ....
27/08/2019, 00:58 - Liz: Okay but you haven't even apologized😪 you don't care anymore
27/08/2019, 00:59 - Liz: Ohhh
27/08/2019, 00:59 - Liz: Goodnight
27/08/2019, 01:03 - Liz: I had forgotten this.. I curved all the guys just waiting for you😪
27/08/2019, 01:09 - TJ Musiitwa: I really did care and still do not just as much as I used to. I don't want it to be messy between us it is as you have clearly stated out that you don't know if it can happen again. I totally respect that and maybe whatever the future holds will happen.
I apologize for bringing this up again, I know you didn't want and don't want to hear about this again. I am sorry if there was anything I was supposed to do and did not, was meant to say but didn't, for all the times that you needed my support and I couldn't do that. 
I hope the next guy lucky to have you is better than I ever was and treats you well.
27/08/2019, 01:13 - TJ Musiitwa: Well curve no more, I hope they really appreciate you 🙂.
Whole heartedly and honestly I really do.

I guess I didn't see the signs, that said you were waiting for me.

Goodnight to you, sorry for not trying harder
27/08/2019, 01:15 - TJ Musiitwa: Have a good day and hope all this is out of your mind not to sour your day or week
05/09/2019, 00:43 - TJ Musiitwa: So is it out of my position to ask  how it's going with the guys you are no longer curving...
🙂
05/09/2019, 09:44 - Liz: 😂😂 what?
05/09/2019, 09:44 - TJ Musiitwa: Ehh your guys
05/09/2019, 09:48 - Liz: I don't know what happened to them😁 I still chase them away
05/09/2019, 10:23 - TJ Musiitwa: Well might as well give one of them a chance
05/09/2019, 10:24 - TJ Musiitwa: If they are still asking for it
05/09/2019, 10:48 - Liz: 🤗🤗🤗 nop
05/09/2019, 10:48 - Liz: All that stress for what
05/09/2019, 12:35 - TJ Musiitwa: We all have our own definitions of stress
05/09/2019, 12:36 - TJ Musiitwa: I frankly speaking being in a relationship isn't stress to begin with
05/09/2019, 12:44 - Liz: I'm not emotionally ready  for this
05/09/2019, 12:45 - Liz: Yeah but stress is subjective.. It varies from one person.. 
And I personally get really stressed over small small things so really
12/09/2019, 15:27 - Liz: Hi
12/09/2019, 15:27 - Liz: How are you...
12/09/2019, 15:28 - Liz: Do you know a person who can help fix a laptop
12/09/2019, 15:28 - Liz: <Media omitted>
12/09/2019, 15:28 - Liz: Its that bad
12/09/2019, 16:51 - TJ Musiitwa: Nope ....
12/09/2019, 16:52 - TJ Musiitwa: But this is likely an LCD screen crack so it'll involve replacing the panel not the laptop itself
12/09/2019, 16:52 - TJ Musiitwa: It'll likely be a big fix.... expensive a lil bit
12/09/2019, 17:56 - Liz: 😳

Should it hit the young baby who knows nothing about life or the old person with her walking stick and both are walking opposite sides of each other on the zebra crossing?
