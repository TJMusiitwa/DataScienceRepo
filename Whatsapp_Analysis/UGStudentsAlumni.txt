29/12/2017, 10:49 - +60 11-2803 7720: Dear Compatriots, dear Friends,

I am pleased to express the warm wishes I have for each and everyone of you as we approach the dawn of the new year. In the past year, we have demonstrated  several abilities. Whereas some of us have built castles on top of hills, some have had their walls broken but what we can all agree upon as a great achievement for 2017 was the establishment of *Uganda Students and Alumni association.*

Currently, we can recognise the fact that for each and everyday, the space between us is narrowing. I would hope that we all recognise the need to empower ourselves more looking to the future.

Upon establishment, we all had strong feelings for the association. However, it will not survive unless we work together to renew and demonstrate our confidence in the future and a feeling of real solidarity, together as one, with love, generosity and mutual respect as members of the association.

Our thoughts and ideas will build for the future and we expect every generation to add a stone to our foundations. However, it takes a strongly cemented foundation to hold those added stones. It is in this spirit that I request members to selflessly contribute to the success of our Association.

To all those who, through their their efforts and action, have contributed to the inauguration of our association, I hope that their efforts thrive in this achievement. 

To each and everyone of you members, I wish you a *Very Happy New Year, 2018.* 
May it bring with it more fulfilled promises.

Daaki

30/12/2017, 08:28 - +256 755 911999: READ AND GIVE ME YOUR ANSWER: A widow mom leaves her house and goes to fetch water, leaving her only child asleep. On her return, she found a large crowd around her burning house. On the inside, her son is about to die in the fire. Throwing her bowl of water on the floor, and crying, she wants to get into the burning house to look for her son. Everyone keeps saying, "You're going to die too, fire is very great." Escaping from their hands, she enters the fire and wrapped her son in a blanket. The child, tight against her breast, is not touched by the fire. Mummy comes out severely burnt and is only narrowly saved; thanks to the care of the hospital, but she lives with scars and unrecognizable. Many years passed. The child, under the guidance of his mother, completed his studies and was appointed minister. He organized a party at his villa on his appointment, and invited all the dignitaries of the city and his friends. While they were in full party, noises were heard at the door of the entrance to the villa. The son was forced to go and resolve the situation. He found that the security officers were preventing his mother from joining the party. He had not invited her but she also wanted to join the party. Faced with this situation in front of his guests, he said tenderly to his mother: "Please, Mom, I would be ashamed to have you appear before my friends. We can discuss later. " And in secret, he ordered the security services to throw out his mother because of her scars ...❕ What inspires you in this story? This woman represents Jesus Christ who sacrificed himself for you and I. Today, what place do you give him in your life❓ It is He who has received the scars because of you and me. If you are ashamed of Him, keep this message and don't  send it to anyone. If you are not ashamed of the scars of Jesus Christ, if you have received Him as your  Lord and Savior in your heart, convey this message to twelve persons. ✉ Jesus Christ tells us in Mark 8, 38: "... For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the Holy angels. "✨ 👏 You still have time to tell at least 12 people that Jesus loves them. As for me, I started this mission with you.
Psalm 126. God asked me to tell you: That everything will be alright from now on... You're to be victorious and will achieve all your goals. Today, Jesus  Christ visited your home. On his way out, he took all your problems with him. Do me a favor. Trust God and share this message with twelve friends of yours , do not ignore and watch in 4 minutes, you will receive a very nice news. It cost nothing to share.

04/01/2018, 01:59 - +60 16-315 8407: A Muslim man in Egypt killed his wife because she was reading the Bible and then buried her with their infant baby and an 8 year old daughter. The girls were buried alive! then He reported to the police that an uncle killed the kids. 15 days later, another family member died. When they went to bury him, they found the 2 little girls under the sand - ALIVE! The country is outraged over the incident, and the man will be executed.The older girl was asked how she had survived and she says 'A man wearing shiny clothes, with bleeding wounds in his hands, came every day to feed us. He woke up my mom so she could nurse my sister,' she said. She was interviewed on Egyptian National TV, by availed Muslim woman news anchor. She said on public TV, 'This was none other than JESUS, because nobody else does things like this!', Muslims believe Isa (JESUS) would do this, but the wounds mean He really was crucified, and it's clear also that He is alive! But, it's also clear that the child could not make up a story like this, and there is no way these children could have survived without a true miracle. Muslim leaders are going to have a hard time to figure out what to do with this, and the popularity of the Passion movie doesn't help! With Egypt at the centre of the media and education in the Middle East , you can be sure this story will spread.Christ is still turning the world upside down! Please let this story be shared. The Lord says, 'I will bless the person who puts his trust in me.' Jeremiah 17.. Please forward these to all on your list and GOD will reward you abundantly!!!!!!!!!!! Please finish reading before you do anything else right now. Read this to the end. My name is God. I know you will give your time for me. I love you and always bless you. I am always with you. I need you to spend 30 minutes of your time with me today. Don't pray. Just praise. Today I want this message across the world before midnight. Will you help? Please do not cut it and I'll help you with something that you are in need of. A blessing is coming your way. Please drop everything & pass it on. Tomorrow will be the Best Day of your Life. Send this to 14 friends in 10min. Tell the devil you are a blessed child of God and you have more to be thankful for than to worry about. We must go through the storm to appreciate the sunshine! This is a test to see who has more followers. God or satan. If God, forward to 14 people, if satan, ignore this! God is going to fix two things (BIG) tonight in your favor. Trust God.

30/01/2018, 13:01 - +60 17-652 5256: WHY FATHERS ARE NEGLECTED IN OLD AGE. AND MEN, KINDLY BE READY TO DIE PREMATURE DEATHS. 

 (Take your time and read through.) 

1. In the lifetime of most African family settings, there are 3 Dispensations of Power.

2. The 1st is the first 25 years in the life of the family  (father, mother, children) where power indisputably rest with the father.

3. The 2nd is after the kids have grown & started working when the power shifts to the mother.

4. The 3rd is when the kids move out of the family house or start their own families when the power moves to the children.

6. We'll start from the 1st Dispensation. Total dominance of the father. He is the Lion of the Tribe of his House. The boss.

7. During this dispensation, the father rules with an iron fist. He barks orders & determines what does or does not happen.

8. The father often mettes out corporal punishment to the recalcitrant children. They grow to fear him more than they love him.

10. The father is the provider for the family & everyone is aware of that fact with all attendant consequences.

11. Then the 2nd Dispensation sets in. The children have finished school and have started working. Power shifts to the mother.

12. When the children start earning their own money, for some reason, it's their mothers they decide to look after. They are closer to her.

13. While the father was in charge, he was busy with the business of providing. He didn't have much time to be a friend to the children.

14. They spent more time with their mum and invariably grew closer to her. They also see their mum as co-victims of the father's tyranny.

15. The mother takes centre stage at this point. She is the first to know what's happening with the children & she has advantage.

16. Should any of the daughters give birth, she is the one that goes for babysitting and the children spoil her with gifts.

17. At this stage, the father is wishing for some bond with the children like they have with their mother but that boat has sailed.

18. Because the mother doesn't rely much on the father for her needs at this stage, she is less likely to tolerate his lordship. Friction.

19. Then the 3rd and last dispensation. Power has shifted to the children. They are self-sufficient, live on their own & have own families.

20. More often than not, whenever there is a quarrel between father & mother, the children side the mother.Years of joint-victimhood at play

21. Children have been known to come to the house to warn their father not to 'disturb' their mother. Next thing, extended visitations.

22. Woe betide the father if his finances are precarious at this stage. You will be humble by force. The gang-up is real.

23. This causes most men to fall ill & develop different complications. By the time the forces are arrayed against you, you will think well.

24. Stroke, Hypertension, High-Blood Pressure. The man has a large family but no relationship with them in later life. Troubling thought.

25. Moral, dear men, while the power lies with us, let us wield it with posterity in mind. It won't be with us forever.

26. With the way you are treating your wife now, how will she treat you when power shifts to her?

27. What relationship do you have with your family? Loving dad or despotic, tyrannical provider?

28. Remember, the children always side with their mother. Aim to do enough to at least get a fair hearing in future moments of family strife

30. Invest wisely for the future so that you won't have to beg to be taken care of if despite your best efforts, you find yourself alone.

May God help us.

Which invisible powers prevent them from crossing and glorifying the Most High God, Creator of universal, the Most Magnificent and Merciful God, the one who called Abraham?

03/02/2018, 10:22 - +256 701 406572: *Summary of Preaching at Mowzey service*

1. When you are moving around with your celebrity title you look tall, yet when you go back home, you're as short as a plastic cup!

2. You get women and leave them in bed feeling cold while you hop from one bar to another. At the end of the day when you're dead, these are the same women who will cover your dead body!

3.You go around having different children from different women all around like mosquitoes do!!😂😂😂😂😂

4. Then there are those men at 60 or 70 still going around dating very young gals, my friend, what type of energy do you think you still have?! You are just going to break your back for nothing!!..you be there!😂😂

5. And for some of you here in church who remain seated while others are standing to pray simply because you're not a Catholic, I want you to know that, it's not only your religion that will attend your funeral!!😂😂😂😂😂. When you attend a funeral for a particular religion, you should become that particular religion at that moment.

6. Some of you are 40 years old and still living with your parents yet your portion of food is always bigger than everybody else's, at 40 you're still in your parent's house yet you are not a Reverend or priest.

7. You find a whole grown man calling himself a celeb yet he stinks so bad! Doesn't bathe, doesn't brush his teeth and all he knows is how to fold chapatis and eat all day!😂😂😂😂😂😂

8. You find a 34 year woman staying in a single rented room and driving. She moves around bragging how she bought the car from uprooted money ( sente enkuule ).

*Malaysia to Deport Traffic Offenders with FAKE drivers license*

Immigration dept head Datuk Seri Mustafar Ali said that Immigration Dept is to consider severe penalties, including deportation, for immigrant workers who are repeat traffic offenders and those with Expatriate pass following various traffic offences committed repeatedly by immigrant workers, students and expatriates such as *having no driving licence and road tax and using fake documents* we cannot compromise even if they carry a valid work permit. The Road Transport Department, Royal Malaysia Police and Malaysian Crime Prevention Foundation should be involved to arrest and detained suspects.

18/02/2018, 10:00 - +60 10-767 0113: 1. *Take the stairs and always carry your own stuff*
This represents firm proponent of doctor Hinohara, he still takes two steps at a time climbing the stairs.

2. *Do not believe everything your doctor recommends or says*
Explore, read and educate yourself. You do not have to believe in everything your doctor says.

3. *Share what you know*
Dr. Hinohara gives 150 lectures on an annual basis in schools, business communities etc. He often shares lessons on war and peace. Do not forget that most of the lessons (90 min) are done standing up.

4. *You do not have to retire*
If you love the work you do, you do not have to retire.

5. *Plan ahead*
If you want to enjoy your life better, you have to have busy schedule fill with different appointments, lectures, work, etc. Dr. Hinohara is planning to attend the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

6. *Don’t be overweight*
Dr. Hinohara consumes a tbsp of olive oil, orange juice and coffee for breakfast. Cookies and milk for lunch and rice, fish and veggies for dinner. He consumes 100g of lean meat two times a week.

7. *Energy does not come from sleeping a lot or eating well, it comes from feeling good*
You will be more happy and energetic if you eliminate strict time-regulated rules, be like children – have a lots of fun until you feel sleepy or hungry.

8. *It is wonderful to live long*
He continues serving society, he volunteers, works 18h per day, 7 days a week and he also enjoy every single moment of his life.

9. *Find a role model*
The doctor usually asks himself what his father would do when he faces with some issue.

10. *Do not worry too much, life is unpredictable and full of incidents*
The doctor was hijacked by the communist Red Army when he has 59 years old. He spent 4 days under 40 degree heat and handcuffed to his seat. He is also amazed how his body slowed down to adapt to deprivation.

11. *Science alone can not help or cure people*
The doctor believes that every illness can be cured with liberal and visual arts. He also believes in the uniqueness of every single individual.

12. *Do not be crazy for money*
The doctor is more than aware that he can not take anything when he goes!

13. *Pain is mysterious*
You have to do something fun if you want to forget about pain. The doctor found that music and animals can really help you to get rid of and mange your pain.

14. *Be inspired*
You must find inspiration in the World in order to motivate yourself. For ex: he finds motivation in the poem “Abt Vogler” by Robert Browning.

24/02/2018, 07:09 - +60 17-652 5256: FYI
I actually went to the embassy yesterday, asking for a letter that authenticates my driving license so i can take it to JPJ to exchange for Malaysian driving license. They made some inquiries on a call and in a few mins they told me that new malaysian rules dont accept international students to change driving license except for phD students(and only those in public universities). The rest, u cant unless u're a diplomat. So they didnt issue the letter foe me to exchange license at JPJ.
24/02/2018, 07:11 - +60 17-652 5256: They said JPJ will no longer issue an exchange of license to international students who are not doing phD(from public universities) (nottingham students sorry), anyway i actually confirmed this with JPJ. The only option they said is to re-do that driving school thing. Its the fastest way for u now to aquire a license. Desist from driving without a valid one.
24/02/2018, 07:11 - +60 17-652 5256: 'Its horrible being in their court.'

24/02/2018, 07:19 - +60 17-652 5256: I'd say they are horrible and vaguely stated.
24/02/2018, 07:45 - +60 11-2552 4702: How about if you have an international driving license from your home country can that one work
24/02/2018, 08:49 - +60 17-652 5256: Rules are vaguely stated  u can meet a police officer who doesnt evn know the rules regarding IDPs. So best thing is to get the malay license if u can

They usually give a fine of RM 300 if the “Saman” is issued by police or a fine of not more than RM1500 if the “Saman” is issued by JPJ. 
The judge told me that I was driving under the law and there was no traffic offence.

24/02/2018, 10:01 - +60 11-2803 7720: Just to tell you, the laws are the same for both foreigners and locals. There isn’t a specific set of laws for foreigners 
If you are arrested under any offence and charged under a section of any act, it will be the same in which a local person will be charged for the same offence. 
If it’s a traffic offence like not having a driving licence, every one is charged under the same law regardless of race or origin. And you usually pay the same fine. Judges at most times always issue a minimum punishment for first time offenders well just after a litigation in this case.
So, worry not, the laws aren’t tough on foreigners only, but on everyone. 
Please note: I have a lot of experience with the Malaysian Legal system.
24/02/2018, 10:03 - +60 11-2803 7720: Actually it can’t be. Only the issuing authority can renew it.

24/02/2018, 10:21 - +256 701 406572: The importance of perspective and intelligent analysis... 

During World War II, numerous fighter planes were getting hit by anti-aircraft guns. 

Air Force officers wanted to add some protective armor/shield to the planes. The question was "where"?

The planes could only support few more kilos of weight. A group of mathematicians and engineers were called for a short consulting project. 

Fighter planes returning from missions were analysed for bullet holes per square foot. They found 1.93 bullet holes/sq. foot near the tail of the planes whereas only 1.11 bullet holes/sq. foot close to the engine.
 
The Air Force officers thought that since the tail portion had the greatest density of bullets, that would be the logical location for putting an anti-bullet shield. 

A mathematician named Abraham Wald said exactly the opposite; more protection is needed where the bullet holes aren't - that is -around the engines.
 
His judgement surprised everyone.  He said "We are counting the planes that returned from a mission. Planes with lots of bullet holes in the engine did not return at all."

*Debrief*
 
If you go to the recovery room at the hospital, you’ll see a lot more people with bullet holes in their legs than people with bullet holes in their chests.  That’s not because people don’t get shot in the chest; it’s because the people who get shot in the chest don’t recover.

Remember the words of Einstein - "Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted, counts."

The poor brings the money, through saving, and the rich takes it, through borrowing. A poor person saves the money because they have more money than their thinking capacity. So they keep the money in the bank so they can go and think what to do with the money they saved._

*On the other side, the rich people come to pick that money, through borrowing, because they have more ideas than the money they have. On a practical side, please show me one billionaire who got rich through saving and I will show you a million Kenyans who have money saved in the banks and are still renting the houses that the Millionaires and billionaires build through the poor people savings which the rich borrowed from a bank.*

28/03/2018, 20:31 - +256 755 911999: My fellow black men, not just in Uganda:

Everyone pays attention to what car you drive because we're visual creatures. Not because the car you drive defines where you are in life.

Having a wife, a mistress and a sidechick is expensive, distracting and exhausting. You will end up with nothing after a lifetime of trying to please them all.

While Jews and Indians are building great things and breaking untold ground. Our best hope is to tear each other down in order to get up. 🤦🏾‍♂

You will call the man who saves and controls his spending foolish and applaud the one that wastes the little they have. We must pop bottles!!! We must be fresh to death. Try popping a mid size factory.

Try making some of the garbage you waste money on. Try making a T shirt for $2 And sell it for $60. Try buying the Gold from Buhweju at Shs 120k/Gram and sell it to a Chinaman for SHs 135k/Gram. Instead of buying a gold chain from an Indian in the Gold souk for $500.

How about you adore your wife and make mad love to her twice a week? Maybe then you won't need to run after little ratchet things... she also won't need to look for it elsewhere. If you're on a date with her on Friday night it will be very hard for you to look for strays.😂

If you spend a little more time with your daughter you might not have to witness her being knocked up by the first guy that told her she is beautiful. If you talk to your son twice a day, you might stop him doing that thing in the future that will get him locked up.

I am trying to catch up with the me that God purposed me to be... I am a long way off!!! but

10/04/2018, 16:03 - +256 701 406572: *Assumption Kills*

A few days ago in the village, I went to an event, a house warming ceremony. When I entered the compound, I saw some village elders I knew sitting in one corner. I went up to them and started to greet them one after the other. I shook their hands, even with the ones I didn't know until I got to one man. I didn't know him and when I extended my hand, he ignored it. After a few seconds, I withdrew the hand.

I felt very embarrassed and angry. Embarrassed for myself and angry at the man. What was he feeling like, I thought. All those other men accepted my greeting, older men even. And to my knowledge, I hadn't done anything wrong. I gave him a very scornful look, greeted the remaining men and went to take a seat.

Now even after I sat down, I was still pissed. I kept stealing glances at the man to see how he would react to other people. Then I saw it.

He was blind.

His eyes were open, but he couldn't see at all! The other people who came to greet him had to touch him first, then take his hand if they wanted to shake hands with him. Now my embarrassment level tripled. In addition to that, I felt stupid, very stupid. I was still angry, just angry at myself. I felt like that till I left the occasion.

Assumption kills like poison. Any small thing, we assume. Someone doesn't pick our calls, we assume he or she is avoiding us or is up to something. Someone doesn't give us the money we asked for, we assume he or she is stingy and wicked.

Once we are turned  or rejected, we start assuming. We don't put into consideration what the other party might be going through. The guy that promised you money might get into a financial situation a day before he's supposed to give you the money. The person that didn't pick your call was probably in a meeting or too busy at that moment, or even sleeping. He might not be in the mood to take your call.

But we just assume instead because it’s easier and it tends to make us the good guys...

This takes us to another vice that is rampant among men -  passing judgment on persons without hearing from them.

God did not pass judgment on Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden without affording them fair hearing. Similarly, Nebuchadnezzar listened to Shadrach, Meshak  and Abednego before passing judgment on them.

17/04/2018, 11:30 - +256 701 406572: Google translated. I just love this response to Macron.


French President Emmanuel Macron said: "With a family that has seven, eight children in Africa, invest billions, nothing will change. (...) The challenge of Africa is civilizational. "The Guinean sociologist Amadou Douno, a professor at the Ahmadou-Dieng University of Conakry, answers him.

"Africans do not need your debauchery civilization. Because with your civilization: a man can sleep with a man; a woman can sleep with a woman; a single president can have two mistresses at a time; a woman can sleep with her dog; a child can insult his father and mother without problem; a child can imprison his parents. "

 "With your civilization, when parents are getting older, they are taken to the retirement home, and finally, with your civilization, a young man can live with a woman who is his mother's age or his grandma without problem. Your case is a perfect illustration! Africans have no civilization lesson to receive from people like you!

Africa is by far the richest continent in the world with its enormous mineral wealth. What is delaying this continent is the large-scale pillage of its resources by the great powers, France in the lead! "

"All the misery of Africa comes from this country that realizes its ambitions on the backs of Africans, with the complicity of these traitors who do not hesitate to sacrifice entire generations by delivering their countries to the former colonizing power.

 They entrust all the key sectors of their economies to France. In reality, they lead the political strategy or vision desired by the former settler. This contributes to driving their populations into misery and extreme poverty. This is the cause of coups d'état, civil wars, genocides, famines, with despots at the head of these countries that are kept in power by France, because it meets all their requirements! "

"France is nothing without Africa! The day the African countries turn their backs on France, this country will plunge into chaos! As long as African countries do not abandon this domination of the former colonial power, by taking charge of their own destiny, as the Asian countries have done, it will be very difficult for them to get out of the abyss. 
The challenge for Africa is to get rid of France. Because the latter is not the solution to its underdevelopment, it is at the heart of the problem! " 
Excellent Week to everyone!

18/04/2018, 10:47 - +256 701 406572: Good morning

 *MONEY ISN’T ALL YOU NEED!* 

There’s a way we tend to glorify money/material possessions that sometimes borders on insanity. Ever seen somebody very restless just because they are broke? What about one very arrogant just because they feel they can handle every eventuality/Situation with their financial muscle?

 True, there is a sense of insecurity that grips a broke person but we must be sure to tame ‘us’ when blessings come our way. 

*FOOD FOR THOUGHT:* 

Twenty years after Jacob had fled from his brother whose blessing he’d stolen, he thought like many of us that his riches would earn him a soft spot in Esau’s heart.

 *_3 Then Jacob sent messengers ahead to his brother, Esau, who was living in the region of Seir in the land of Edom. 4 He told them, “Give this message to my master Esau: ‘Humble greetings from your servant Jacob. Until now I have been living with Uncle Laban, 5 AND NOW I OWN CATTLE, DONKEYS, FLOCKS OF SHEEP AND GOATS, AND MANY SERVANTS, BOTH MEN AND WOMEN. I HAVE SENT THESE MESSENGERS TO INFORM MY LORD OF MY COMING, HOPING THAT YOU WILL BE FRIENDLY TO ME.’”_*

 *_20 And be sure to say, ‘Look, your servant Jacob is right behind us.’”Jacob thought, “I will try to appease him by sending gifts ahead of me. When I see him in person, perhaps he will be friendly to me.” 21 So the gifts were sent on ahead, while Jacob himself spent that night in the camp. ~Genesis 32:3-5, 20-21NLT_*

 *ESAU’S REACTION:* 

*_8 “And what were all the flocks and herds I met as I came?” Esau asked. Jacob replied, “They are a gift, my lord, to ensure your friendship.” 9 “My brother, I have plenty,” Esau answered. “Keep what you have for yourself.”—Genesis 33:8-9NLT_* 

Never think that your money will make for you an apology for wronging anyone. Don’t allow God’s blessings on you to overshadow your conscious. Success entering your head is a disaster. 

Have a great day.

On behalf of the Organisers and on behalf of the Ugandan Students and Alumni Association in Malaysia, I want to thank you for helping to make this ground breaking dinner a success. There are several milestones reached on that day but key amongst them was the successful launch of the association which we believe will be a great asset the entire Ugandan community in Malaysia. 

We are pleased that we are all in several ways part of the association and we will keep you posted on our progress and hope to call on you again soon.

On the other hand, even when we received a lot compliments, there are always a several inevitable shortcomings which we take responsibility of and promise to learn from them to ensure they do not occur again for all our future diners and gatherings. 

Nonetheless, it was great and delightful to have all of you around on such a short notice. We also pray the relationships and networks that we all got in the different engagements are fruitful and beneficial.

05/05/2018, 09:45 - +60 10-767 0113: *WHY CUBAN HEALTH CARE IS UNIQUE IN THE WORLD*

Cuba has the most medical professionals working in the world's poorest countries;

Cuba has doctors who have performed 3 million free eye operations in 33 countries;

Cuba created the world's largest medical school with 22,000 students;

 Cuba has a ratio of one physician for every 167 people (No. 1 in the world);

Cuba has lower infant mortality and higher life expectancy than the United States;

 Cuba has free, high quality, universal primary health care

The Cuban health care system is the jewel in the crown of Cuban achievements. Here I choose to focus on Cuba's medical internationalism, a practice admired throughout the world.

After the Cuban revolution of Jan. 1, 1959, which overthrew the brutal Batista dictatorship, about half of Cuba's doctors fled the island for more lucrative practices, most to Miami. Yet even under these dire circumstances and the crushing U.S. embargo that followed, Cuba began dispatching volunteer medical contingents abroad.

Many people are surprised to learn that Cuban medical professionals have saved more lives in the Third World than all the wealthy G-8 nations combined, plus the World Health Organization and the Nobel Peace Prize recipient Doctors without Borders.

As noted by Cuba expert John Lee Anderson, "At any given time, there are an estimated 50,000 Cuban doctors working in slums and rural areas in as many as 30 other developing nations around the world."

And because Cuba believes health care is a fundamental human right, these totally volunteer services are provided to recipients gratis. One remarkable example among many follows from Cuba's world class specialization in ophthalmology. Under Operacion Milagro (Operation Miracle), Cuban specialists have performed vision-restoring surgery to 2 million people in 34 countries, again at no cost.

In sentiments shared by people from Asia and Africa to Latin American and the Caribbean, Bolivian President Evo Morales expressed his gratitude for Cuba's crucial medical assistance to his country by saying, "Cuba has shown its solidarity to us by sending 'troops' who save lives — not like other countries which send troops to end lives."

In 1999, Cuba founded ELAM (the Latin America School of Medicine), the world's largest medical school. It offers a free education (including books and a living stipend) to students from poor countries, and more than 10,000 students have graduated from its highly respected six-year program. The only requirement is that students make a moral commitment to return home and serve marginalized populations. Note: Since 2007, more than 100 young people from the U.S. have graduated from ELAM and returned to work in underserved areas of the United States.

Cuban children are socialized to watch out for the weakest, to empathize with others who are less fortunate. A volunteer physician in Venezuela added, "We Cuban doctors devote everything to love and solidarity because that's what we've been taught since we were little, in school." This was a founding principle of the Cuban revolution.

Cuba's robust medical internationalism contradicts the common-sense, bleak view of human nature, the dominant narrative of hyper individualism and the profit motive. I suggest that we remain open to the possibility that some cultures are compatible with the lived expression of empathy while other cultures suppress it.

Cuba's practice of moral medicine is the world's most compelling example of empathetic solidarity. Despite overwhelming odds, this small country of 11 million people has taken empathy from the abstract realm and brought it down to earth. We court both personal and national peril by not learning more about it.

05/05/2018, 12:27 - +256 701 406572: Thanks Jaffar for such educative piece which has answered many questions I had. As many young men and women dream to work in green pastures, Cubans are patriotically taught to serve the poor, unfortunate and in third world. To them humanity first to save lives and money just bonus! Long live all workers sacrificing to serve in remote areas despite pressure to move to first world economies
05/05/2018, 12:53 - +60 10-767 0113: 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
05/05/2018, 13:52 - Eria Kamya: That's not what we are concerned about as Ugandans. We are not Cubans and we are not in Cuba but *we are Ugandans in Uganda* We all know the the history of Cuba and as well know the history of Uganda. Cuba learned from their history and we didn't learn from ours. We are actually going back. 

 Further worse is that we have no direction. Many countries when faced with the same shortages first think about how to domestically deal with them not to import human resource. This is simply because it's not sustainable and such a thing can not be seen by an aging president. You can all agree with me, our beloved president can not think beyond twenty years from now. This is natural and should not be objected.

 The country's economic state has worsened due to importation of goods and now we're importing human resources who will add to the repatriation problem. It would be okay if we didn't have our own doctors.

 I just think the government salary structures should be revised and I liked it when the president talked about the administrators who earn over 20 million yet they're highly dispensable. The president himself boasted about earning only 3.5M but I doubt whether he even spends it at all. It's just accumulating month by month. If at all he can even donate the mind blowing sums of money these days. 

It could be true that our doctors are not patriotic or are impatient but they are less to blame. Uganda has money but poorly handled. 

*That's my own view of the situation in Uganda*
05/05/2018, 15:15 - +256 701 406572: Yes bro Kamya I respect your views. However the one who shared was not intending to discuss importation of Cuban Doctors but *Cuban Health Care system*. What lessons we can learn from it and benchmark. To me, that's important and they will advise us well. Many people especially Chinese and Europeans and now Cubans see value in working in Africa while young Africans see only migrating out of the continent. Till our education system addresses those issues which others see and cry to work on the continent and we can't see them, we shall continue to lament.
05/05/2018, 15:40 - +60 12-380 9334: DON'T IMPORT CUBAN DOCTORS, IMPORT CUBAN PRESIDENT

By Odaka Asuman
I'd refused to comment on the halubaloo of importing the Cuban doctors until i realised something wasn't being discussed about the issue.
Three areas need to be highlighted to put the issue into perspective.

When Mr. M7 came to power, most professionals had fled the country, medical sector was one of the most hit. Mr. M7 quickly ran to Cuban & asked Cuba's Fidel Castro for 100 doctors but instead Mr. Castro offered to give him grant to construct a teaching hospital so that Uganda can train its own doctors other than importing them. This is how we got #MbararaUniversityOfScienceAndTechnolofy. It also explains why the first medical trainers at #MUST were Cubans nationals. 30+ years now we w'ldn't be talking about importing but exporting the doctors. Instead we are all talking as if nothing happened without remembering anything instead we shld put Mr. M7 shd be put to task why...

Secondly our doctors are not only asking for salaries but fair working conditions, and availability of tools of trade. To my dismay i saw Mr. M7 basterdising the conversation by shamelessly telling us how he is the lowest paid gov't worker (yet just a year ago he told us that he is not anybody's worker). If our doctors were given just 0.002 of the facilities given to Mr. M7, non would ask for a salary.

The third and most important issue is discussing the issue as if its isolate. Uganda is suffering from multi-organic failure. If you import the Cuban doctors b'se the Ugandan ones are your enemies, then you will need to import the Cuban prosecutors, Cuban judges, Cuban teachers, Cuban traders, Cuban taxi drivers, Cuban students, Cuban boda boda, in fact you will import cuba itself and the problem will not be solved yet it's cheaper to import "Cuban president". B'se he makes things work, Cuban president will train doctors, he will build institution, he will flight corruption, nepotism, tribalism. He will make our education work, he will make our health sector work, he will not boast of substandard roads b'se he will make good ones, he will not favor foreigners, the Cuban president will not give our national asset to his family members and cronies, the Cuban president will not tax Ugandan to poverty, he won't rent support. The Cuban president will be cheaper to maintain.

Mr. President, just import the #CubanPresident

05/05/2018, 15:43 - Eria Kamya: Yes that's very true, but I don't think the Cuban health care system runs itself. Actually before the Ugandan doctors become a problem, the Uganda health care system is already a problem. I hope you watched the *Executive Director of National Drug Authority* when she appeared before the parliamentary Committee. There you would know exactly who to blame for her appointment and why. I also don't think Cuba has issues of doctors stealing medicine from government hospitals. That's why I don't only attack the the president but also the doctors themselves and the entire health system at large. 

Ovcos it's even hard to learn from Cuba or other countries as you've mentioned. Because I think they were once in our state. But the question is whether they imported or solved the issues domestically. We are simply harvesting their fruits (at a cost ovcos) and not learning from how they planted. 

However because I am very objective, we may not have to go through what they went through but we are not different from fools who learn from their mistakes even after failing to learn from history or even failing to learn from others as they do things currently. Otherwise, thank you for your views. Such can transform the nation. 

However, *I am not against anyone but trying to see the other alternatives to our problems*
05/05/2018, 15:50 - Eria Kamya: 👍👍👍👍🤣
05/05/2018, 15:51 - +60 17-652 9845: Reason why Trump refers to Africa as shithole...we always look out for help and can’t even help ourselves🤦🏿‍♀ the Chinese are already doing the most...now we have to deal with this👏🏿 why do we even celebrate independence day🤔 we should just go back to being colonies 🤷🏿‍♀
05/05/2018, 15:52 - Eria Kamya: Just relax Cuba is soon colonising us
05/05/2018, 15:52 - +60 17-652 9845: Thank goodness 😅😅
05/05/2018, 15:55 - Eria Kamya: Because very soon the mps will also strike and the president won't hesitate to import Cuban mps. That's when you'll know that recolonising us is still possible.
05/05/2018, 15:58 - +60 17-652 9845: Well Africa is in debt and that’s enough leverage for control as it is 🤷🏿‍♀
05/05/2018, 15:58 - Eria Kamya: 😅😅😅
05/05/2018, 15:59 - +60 17-652 9845: It’s all just a joke 😅😅 African leaders are jokers and clowns
05/05/2018, 15:59 - +60 17-652 9845: No offense 🙌🏿
05/05/2018, 16:01 - +60 17-364 3269: 😂😂😂😂😂😂Cuban mps , lol
05/05/2018, 16:01 - +60 11-2803 7720: 🤔🤔🤔😨😨😨
05/05/2018, 16:02 - Eria Kamya: We should organise a talk show for this platform aired live on Uganda TVs. Those people should know that we're also concerned and we have ideas. 😅😅😅😅
05/05/2018, 16:02 - +60 17-364 3269: I think it’s upto the young generation to change uganda , young people should stop over complaining  n not leave everything to the govt
05/05/2018, 16:02 - +60 17-364 3269: We should try to change uganda as well
05/05/2018, 16:03 - Eria Kamya: Ovcos the young generation is supposed to spearhead change
05/05/2018, 16:06 - Eria Kamya: How do you think they should implement t the change?
05/05/2018, 16:11 - +60 17-652 9845: Good question 🤔
05/05/2018, 16:13 - +60 17-364 3269: By changing their attitudes towards work , by planning before having 6 children or marrying two wives , by investing in family businesses , by taking part in politics , by getting an education even if it’s just a skill , uganda has so many young people n old people put us behind , it’s upto us to tell the older people to give the youth a chance . 
Anyway at the same time people r illiterate so it gets hard , to put somethings together
05/05/2018, 16:13 - +60 17-364 3269: Ugandans can’t even sing the national Anthem
05/05/2018, 16:13 - +60 17-364 3269: So it goes back to education
05/05/2018, 16:14 - Eria Kamya: 😅😅😅
05/05/2018, 16:15 - +60 17-364 3269: Employment wise , I think those young people who have made it should invest in the country n employ the youth
05/05/2018, 16:19 - Eria Kamya: I just hope one day the Cuban president makes a random visit to Uganda. I want Ugandans to go to the streets wherever he's to pass. We show him love and appreciation, give him gifts. *You never know he can choose to stay here and become our president*🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂😃  because the country is full of generous people from the 1980s when they gave us doctors up to now they're still willing.
05/05/2018, 16:23 - +60 17-652 9845: Personally I think our education system is so back dated🤔 even after uni/college most people can’t get jobs or good paying ones at least...I think they should put more emphasis on skills and most of all stop wasting people’s time with olevels that don’t even add up🤦🏿‍♀...teachers should be trained in spotting out kids interests and talents if so be it...o level in Uganda is basically a gamble...why would someone do sciences when they are clearly into the arts...like that needs revision and the teachers maybe need some sort of training in this
05/05/2018, 16:25 - Eria Kamya: Great idea... *someone does sciences when they are clearly into arts*
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
05/05/2018, 16:27 - +60 17-364 3269: I think most people can’t get jobs bse there is lack of job diversity ,
05/05/2018, 16:27 - +60 17-364 3269: Exactly
05/05/2018, 16:28 - Eria Kamya: Why would even the ministry of education be combined with sports? Just to weaken the education system because the budget is still not proportional to the ministry load.
05/05/2018, 16:28 - +60 11-2803 7720: 😳😳😳😳😳🤔🤔🤔🤔
05/05/2018, 16:29 - +60 17-364 3269: Exactly
05/05/2018, 16:29 - +60 17-652 9845: Brilliant 👏🏿👏🏿 Uganda has so many problems 🤦🏿‍♀
05/05/2018, 16:29 - Eria Kamya: Ye lwaki M7 tomwesimbako?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
05/05/2018, 16:30 - Eria Kamya: True
05/05/2018, 16:31 - +60 17-364 3269: Very many , but if we r to change we have to start with constitution . We have to re write it ,lord how many times do we have to write a constitution
05/05/2018, 16:31 - +60 17-364 3269: Anyway this constitution does not serve Ugandans but people in power
05/05/2018, 16:31 - Eria Kamya: 😅😅😅😅😅🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂ Uganda is stuck in problems
05/05/2018, 16:34 - +60 17-652 9845: There’s so many factors and 1 is also the fact that in Uganda parents don’t involve the children in what they do...like I’ve seen quite a number of people who get introduced to the work environment as early as 15 and by 20 they are sufficient and flourishing...all Ugandan parents do is put you through boarding school 🤣🤦🏿‍♀
05/05/2018, 16:35 - Eria Kamya: Yes that's also very true
05/05/2018, 16:36 - Eria Kamya: But even the business working environment is full of taxes so even people hate working.
05/05/2018, 16:41 - +60 17-652 9845: We have a lot to learn from the Jews and how they run the world
05/05/2018, 17:17 - +256 755 911999: Wow.... Very nice delibarations here. I love the way the minds of young people think and it's nice to see that we are all affected and we are saying something that us a step in the right direction however with our current government we ought to do more say less. Someone here said that Uganda is suffering from multi organ failure.. I couldn't agree more. However charity behind at home... The leaders we have don't just fall from heaven they come from among us so that mess right there depicts the populace and our mannerisms. We have gone from bad to worst in a couple of years n it's sad...but as young people we should not ask what our country does for us(they've CLEARLY failed)...we should ask what we do for our country? 
As for the education system... It's DEAD. Makes me so sad to see parents struggling to put their children through school only for the child to graduate, sit at home for too long they decide to go and work in places like the UAE where black people are treated like slaves. 
Does it shock anyone else that Uganda has 1 international airport?? 1 like this. I believe in Uganda... We've got great human capital, we've got resources, we just need to get organized if we could work together to develop our country not have that each man for his own we would go a long way.
05/05/2018, 17:21 - +60 17-364 3269: True
05/05/2018, 17:46 - Eria Kamya: You have clearly stated your views and I have liked them. But unless you appreciate who the main cause of these issues is, then we're going nowhere. The number one citizen is the final referee to all the major institutions in Uganda. He therefore chooses who heads which institution. I don't know whether it really needed her wife to be the minister of education🤣🤣🤣. That is total greed. You're a first lady, an MP and a minister. And many other positions given to single individuals. That's why many people are poor because a few enjoy a lot. 

Right now the government has a lot of power and it's our MPs who are not doing their part. How long did it take for the government to bring down sudhir? How long did it take them to close bridge schools??  Am also very frustrated by our MPs especially the NRM MPs. Now they've given him life presidency. 😃😃😃😃
05/05/2018, 17:49 - +256 755 911999: Can I be honest... I am totally bored with Museveni n his entire crew....but some of opposition is not any better..
05/05/2018, 17:49 - Eria Kamya: Ovcos the opposition can't be any better
05/05/2018, 17:49 - +60 17-364 3269: They have all committed treason , they should b tried for betraying the country . As her the First Lady , it’s only nepotism . N it’s not just her , the whole govt is about nepotism
05/05/2018, 17:50 - +60 17-364 3269: They r all the same , they come from the same regime , we need new people who come from our regime
05/05/2018, 17:51 - Eria Kamya: We actually need new generation leaders
05/05/2018, 17:51 - +60 17-364 3269: Exactly
05/05/2018, 17:54 - +49 1523 7081413: Wil b ur president 2021 jus vote mi✊🏻
05/05/2018, 17:55 - Eria Kamya: Please post here your manifesto
05/05/2018, 17:55 - +60 17-364 3269: 😂😂😂😂
05/05/2018, 17:56 - +256 755 911999: True...n that's why I don't want to look for work here...I want to go home and join the struggle...my children have to see better. I also call upon each and every one of us. Let's not run from Uganda because of greener pastures... Uganda is our home and if we do not get in and change things.... It will be a big mess. One ours will have to deal with. I know it's easier to look the other way but let's get involved
05/05/2018, 17:57 - +60 17-364 3269: Very well spoken
05/05/2018, 17:59 - +49 1523 7081413: soon
05/05/2018, 18:02 - +60 16-639 0643: Its true brother. One other problem i realised is most of us are in Malaysia to study naye hardly having a plan 4 when stidies are finished. Let events happening back home teach us a lesson. Are you also going back home after leaving here to apply for jobs? Whats your plan?
05/05/2018, 18:07 - +256 755 911999: I am a girl🙈so a sister if u may. I am definitely going home...I have big plans... I believe I don't necessarily need to be a politician to bring about the change I desire to see because power if placed in the wrong hands can be a mess. I want to do some apprenticeship under some mps I like. Get mentored... understand the ball game.. do some law...get equipped with knowledge... while working. I definitely have to get a job at home I need money to start up my projects n I won't steal so I have to work...but definitely got big plans... For my country people n I am a team player so let's do this

05/05/2018, 18:20 - +256 755 911999: But for some people it's not about saving....it's the good roads n systems that actually work that keep them here
05/05/2018, 18:21 - +256 755 911999: Housing... What.. the services gene
05/05/2018, 18:21 - Eria Kamya: Depending on the salary. Just to remind you, one ringgit =900 Uganda shillings. So if you work with a purpose you can get something here
05/05/2018, 18:24 - +60 17-652 9845: Depending on the salary indeed...but well it also depends on your lifestyle
05/05/2018, 18:25 - +256 755 911999: But because of so many situations you might find it hard to save.. sometimes things come up... People from home automatically assume that you have money..so they'll always be asking...then things like visa renewal, rent even just life it self. I am not saying people here don't make some good money they do but one has to be wise...
05/05/2018, 18:26 - Eria Kamya: What's the problem with giving your people money??
05/05/2018, 18:28 - +256 755 911999: There's no problem...but if you have a goal... Let's say u set out to work for 5 years... N hope to save  25mil... But every time u get some Ka money your aunt calls you n asks for money n u give her... 2 days later ure kid bro calls and asks you give him....it will be harder to reach that goal especially because it's harder to survive on a single source of income
05/05/2018, 18:31 - Eria Kamya: Bro you better watch out with that mentality.
05/05/2018, 18:31 - Eria Kamya: Sorry if I used a wrong gender
05/05/2018, 18:32 - +256 755 911999: How do you mean???
05/05/2018, 18:41 - Eria Kamya: I know how people back home can be on your neck for money. But which ever goal you set, don't neglect your people. Probably God elevated you to help your people. We all want to invest but need to (1) enjoy life. (2) inspire others and change their lives. We all want to save for the future and our children. But You can never guarantee what happens when you die to either your children or business. I prefer investing in people first, then business. It's better. The chance is high that even your children are safe.

05/05/2018, 18:43 - +256 755 911999: I am not against helping... Oh my gosh which kind of human do u think I am😳🤣. I believe we are blessed to bless. N that's y I said when they call you give them... However I believe in teaching a man to fish more than giving him the fish because it's more sustainable that way
05/05/2018, 18:43 - Eria Kamya: 🤣😅🤣😅🤣😅🤣
05/05/2018, 18:44 - +60 17-652 9845: True👏🏿👏🏿
05/05/2018, 18:45 - +256 755 911999: We should bless each other... Uplift each other not create beggers around us. Skill people..so that they too can be liberated and independent financially...
05/05/2018, 18:45 - +60 17-652 9845: True also👏🏿👏🏿
05/05/2018, 18:45 - +256 755 911999: Sometimes we spoil people around us ..they will be lazy just coz they know ehh gundi will give me money
05/05/2018, 18:47 - Eria Kamya: Ovcos inspiring others can also mean teaching them how to fish. When they ask for money and you're willing to give them, tell them to draft a simple business budget and you will have taught them how to fish.
05/05/2018, 18:53 - +256 755 911999: We are all African...at ours it's family first no two ways about that... But you can't give what you don't have.. so we need to be smart. N definitely bless as many as you can
05/05/2018, 18:54 - Eria Kamya: I like that
05/05/2018, 19:23 - +60 11-2803 7720: Great ideas, great views from great people. 
Now this is the importance of engagement. 
Thank you so much for these wonderful submissions. 
The topic was heated but at the same time interesting and thoughtful. There are potential leaders and policy makers in this group. I urge us to go back home and give our country such ideas. If we can’t find a platform, we can always create one.
05/05/2018, 19:24 - Eria Kamya: Ok Sir
05/05/2018, 19:25 - +60 17-652 9845: Yes 👏🏿👏🏿
05/05/2018, 19:25 - +60 11-2803 7720: Thank you Mr. Kamya Eria, I followed the discussion from the beginning.

05/05/2018, 22:06 - +256 701 406572: Indeed great discussion, great ideas and I am proud of being in this forum. I have learnt a lot from each submission especially one who said we need to return to Uganda to cause change in whatever level. I have served my country in South Sudan,  CAR,  Somalia and came to Malaysia to study which I completed and now back to serve. Uganda is admirable in rest of Africa. We have peace to do any business. You can have rentals and don't pay tax! You can sell 100 cows or farm produce and don't pay tax! I mean we have a lot of loopholes which favours someone to exploit and become rich. People are exploiting this kavio to grow rich. It's reason Chinese and Indians are running to Uganda. Implementing laws hard so investors exploit and make money. You can't do it in Rwanda or Malaysia. A Malaysia Military Officer was stopped from going to Singapore on our study tour just coz he had not paid PAYE tax. It can't happen in Uganda. So my prayer is come and we work in our beautiful country were you won't be treated badly coz of your skin colour or faith. To me, few people are paying tax as rest invade it causing us to borrow. In Elgon region for instance,  UMEME say electricity theft is so rampant that only 3 people pay per transformer. You can't blame President for this simple errors

09/05/2018, 10:03 - +256 701 406572: A car ahead was moving like a turtle and not giving me way inspite of my continuous honking! I was on brink of losing my cool when I noticed the small sticker on the car’s rear!

“Physically challenged; Please be patient.”

And that changed everything!! I immediately went calm & slowed down!! In fact I got a little protective of the car & the driver!!! I reached work a few minutes late, but it was ok!

And then it struck me.  Would I have been patient if there was no sticker!???! Why do we need stickers to be patient with people!?? 

Will we be more patient & kind with others if people had labels pasted on their foreheads?? 
Labels like ——
“ Lost my job” , “Fighting cancer”, “Going through a bad divorce” , “ Suffering Emotional abuse “ , "Lost a loved one”, “Feeling worthless” , “ Financially broken”..... and more like these!!!!

Everyone is fighting a battle we know nothing about. The least we can do is be patient & kind!!!

Let us respect the invisible labels.

10/05/2018, 16:55 - +256 701 406572: Setting a World Record &  benchmark in reclaiming Democracy
By William de Cruz
10 May 2018, 4:20 pm (Updated 10 May 2018, 4:52 pm)


COMMENT | Malaysians set a world benchmark, a gold standard in how to reclaim democracy against all odds yesterday!

The government coalition that had lorded over a country with various alliances for 61 years threw everything against its Citizens for the 14th General Election - the judiciary, the police, the universities system, the election commission, its very parliament, race and religion.

Gerrymandering and malapportionment saw some federal constituencies with as little as a few thousand voters sit side-by-side with seats that housed more than 150,000 registered voters!!!

The ‘apa lagi Cina mahu’ politics of endless division...

This was a voting population that saw its very government as Adversary.

Yet, like no other country in modern history, millions turned up yesterday and overthrew a murderous, corrupt regime without shedding one drop of blood.

There were no riots, no looting, burning of cars, homes or shops, ugly manifestations of religious or racial bigotry, ignorance or intolerance.

Instead, the people of a multi-racial country that is home to the world's fastest-growing religion, Islam, as well as the two biggest races on the planet, Chinese and Indians, embraced one another to rise above despots, division, discrimination and the albatross of the voting system itself, to UNSEAT a prime minister and coalition that would have sold Malaysia down the drain in return for self-preservation, enrichment and aggrandisement.

The plot twists and ironies that led Malaysia to this historic day could not have been better scripted by the best of Hollywood.

Two men, powerfully galvanising individuals who were each nemesis to the other for nearly two decades - Anwar Ibrahim and Dr Mahathir Mohamad - forged the most unlikely of political alliances.

One remains a Prisoner, the other put him there in shameful circumstances that were played out under the glare of world media spotlights.

The prisoner has shown how the sheer power of Forgiveness can transcend the most painful of pasts. The image of Anwar and Mahathir shaking hands as allies, at one of Anwar's more recent court appearances, is now regarded by many as the turning point for the alliance that is now government-in-waiting.

The jailor and nation-builder declares he has now to FREE Anwar.

The most honourable Lim Kit Siang, Malaysia's longest-standing patriot, a walking symbol of long-standing and unrelenting parliamentary opposition, and the epitome of statesmanship, has carried magnanimity and self-sacrifice to another plane entirely.

Lim has embraced Mahathir, who had also thrown him into jail, and placed his aspirations for Malaysia centre stage for the sake of a pact the likes of which, no other country has ever seen.

And yesterday, out of racism, corruption and bigotry emerged unity, determination and a sense of purpose - to forge a new future, a new hope, a new country for ourselves and our children.

Malaysians have shown a uniqueness that is as palpable as it is inspiring, and we must give ourselves the time and space to be very, very PROUD of what we have achieved today.

We have snatched back Democracy from the jaws of destruction, so Malaysia may be rebuilt all over, with the multi-racial, democratic and egalitarian ideals of its founding fathers and earliest patriots.

We have come from the race riots of May 13, 1969, to the multi-racial juggernaut of May 9, 2018. We fought back without bloodshed or violence!!!

We have returned “Merdeka” - freedom, independence - to our shores. The future is now full of promise, and it's a promise we made to ourselves.

The singular event of May 9 will powerfully resonate forever in our history as a glorious chapter in a people's tenacity.

Yesterday, Malaysians became a beacon to the rest of the world, and delivered a new lesson in non-violent opposition.

The world has not seen such a reversal of fortune as Malaysia's. We are a walking, living legacy.

This is Malaysia, like no other country in the world!!! SALUTE MALAYSIA!!!

11/05/2018, 17:23 - Eria Kamya: We've been getting ashamed internationally since the 1970s. That's why even here in Malaysia whoever asks about my nationality will in their next sentence be like, hmm... *Idd Amin*?? So twaswaalaswaala dda🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤷🏻‍♂🤷‍♂
11/05/2018, 17:29 - +60 16-226 6917: This level of Negativity..😏 Naffe Twakoowa abakoowu
11/05/2018, 17:31 - +60 17-303 4617: You can use that opportunity to add on to their knowledge and say something nice about Uganda😊
11/05/2018, 17:33 - +60 11-2803 7720: Boss, I’ve never ashamed of being Ugandan
11/05/2018, 17:33 - Eria Kamya: We do our best but always let down by the politicians. Recently parliamentary fighting also became another thing.
11/05/2018, 17:35 - +60 11-2803 7720: That was actually something. It got us international media coverage for a full two months. 
We did it better than Taiwan, better than Ukraine and also better than hongkong
11/05/2018, 17:37 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: U have the knowledge to tell them how uganda is a nice country. Uganda is developing even though its slow development and that’s cause of our own leaders who have fake plans and lie to our president so as to feed their families and stomachs. Uganda budget can not do what citizens want because its a small budget to what our country needs. Our country as well was badly planned before and that’s why it’s congested everywhere and we can’t even build roads Or enlarge them. Compasation   Of these people around kla is very expensive of which our government doesn’t have that money. Let’s be proud of our own country and stop complaining
11/05/2018, 17:44 - +256 782 688599: I like your line of reasoning
11/05/2018, 17:45 - +60 17-652 9845: that wasn’t a bad thing tho...all parliaments have scuffles like that recently Nigeria took the crown 🤣 but all in all there’s no such thing as bad press...thing is what do u do with the spotlight 🤔

11/05/2018, 17:47 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Thank you Karol
11/05/2018, 18:22 - Eria Kamya: My country is good and I have on several occasions invited people to it, magnifying the source of the longest river in the world among others. But certain things get viral beyond our control. Our country has a small budget but not smaller than that of Rwanda. And please no one misleads the president. Do we have anyone in Uganda whose frequency of visiting other countries is higher than that of the president?? And that's what he's been doing for all the years in service He's simply devoting all the resources towards what keeps him in his current seat. Today he's strongly against the bad Western culture such as  homosexuality but the day it will have to do with his seat you'll see.

This problem is actually bigger than you think and sometimes I even blame our nationalists. It has a lot to do with ignorance and greed combined. 

 These other countries we are comparing ourselves with (Taiwan, Ukraine, Hong Kong, Nigeria etc) are far braver than us except for Rwanda which are far more cowards than us. But at least their head is working. And if we compare ourselves with these countries we should not leave out how the things ended or the results. There we can proudly compare ourselves with them. 

I don't mean to say that I am negative about the system. Here everyone is concerned but everyone still does nothing. And if we want to transform the country, we should stop boasting about funny things which even keep us in the same state. I will continue advocating for goodness of my country until every natural beauty of it is sold to investors.

11/05/2018, 19:07 - Eria Kamya: 🤦‍♂😃🤣🤷🏻‍♂
11/05/2018, 19:26 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: U talk of rwanda. What’s the size of rwanda to Uganda. What’s the population of rwanda and Uganda. What’s its GDP of rwanda and Uganda?? What’s the mentality of citizens of those countries u compare with. Ask yourself all such questions before you compare.
11/05/2018, 19:47 - Eria Kamya: I actually wanted to compare the two proportionately. But at least our *human resource* should be the variable to support us without question. But if a smaller country is able to manage their national airlines and we can't, then it becomes deliberately state-failed. Now the United Nations air Base in Entebbe has so far been partially shifted to Nairobi. Proportionately, we should have more human resource but this shows certain things. If we can buy and as well support the military aircrafts, then it means we have the right human resource to run the national airlines. You remember how they were showcased at the 50th independence anniversary. 

If you think Rwanda is smaller and thus proportionately better off, Should we also stand to say that proportionately, Rwanda is better in human resource than us?? The answer is no. That's when you'll come to believe how things are deliberately messed up.
11/05/2018, 20:03 - Eria Kamya: I wish Magezi's bill was to ensure that the president is safeguarded from any court summons after leaving office. Because that's what is keeping him clinging on the seat. He is not sure of his destiny outside the state house. This would be the bill of the century
12/05/2018, 01:05 - +44 7914 583339: When you combine a data scientist and politics..😂
12/05/2018, 01:12 - +44 7914 583339: this man typing another paragraph.. abeg
12/05/2018, 01:13 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣😃 the country needs such. If you carefully observe around the world, those who actually transform nations are not typical politicians. And the reason is simple. Politicians see politics as a form of employment. Other professionals come in to rescue the state and not to seek for employment. They already have secured their employment with their careers. A good example is Malaysia's new prime minister.
12/05/2018, 01:15 - +44 7914 583339: you are right...
12/05/2018, 01:43 - +60 11-2803 7720: Very informative and articulate contributions. 
Thank you Mr. Kamya Eria and others.
We encourage such discussions here. 🤝🤝

https://www.facebook.com/desdinasi/posts/10156352695202387
12/05/2018, 07:04 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Point of correction. There is no politician who takes politics as employment. Just a quick question for u. Name for me any politician in Uganda who has no other businesses. For my information there is none. The only politicians who may perhaps see politics as employment are those from universities and go to parliament of which such a rare.
12/05/2018, 07:06 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: People who leave other professionals to come to power like trump they be coming to fulfill there self actualisation  which is having more power
12/05/2018, 07:08 - +60 17-364 3269: I think u don’t understand wat he is trying to say , Ugandan politicians take  politics as employment , in a way that they want to work there forever , they don’t want to leave , m7 said he is working for his kids n family , they employ there family members n friends , they have turned the whole system about them . That’s wat he is trying to say . N it’s true u can’t deny , it . N yes they have other jobs else where but they may not b as paying as there political jobs ,they want position n power . So they take it as employment
12/05/2018, 07:10 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: I talked about the mentality of citizens. Maybe you don’t know the mentality of Ugandans and therefore u really need to know it better. You see in uganda everything is very possible for example  u can get a passport or driving license for another person who isn’t uganda, u know why cause of our citizens mentality of not transforming a country but their families and relates (too much corruption) in Rwanda HE kagame put up strict rules governing the country and that’s why it has transformed. U can as well see the kagame mentality is totally different from our m7. M7 said his not working for anyone but his family now do u see the mentality am talking about. So if Eria you given a job in government u will also say my boss works for his family let me also work for my family and that’s how the entire citizens get rotten
12/05/2018, 07:13 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Let me inform that power is not employment and if u ever want a lifetime employemt it’s not politics the way u saying. The dynamics of politics u can never take it as employment and if u do so then u doomed. Remember in politics u have no friend, everyone is your enemy even your own son.
12/05/2018, 07:14 - +60 17-364 3269: I didn’t say power is employment , n yes politics is a life time employment , u just have to bend the rules to suit u like the way m7 does
12/05/2018, 07:15 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: About you saying m7 is working for his family that’s the mentality am talking about. His the forehead father of this nation whom everyone looks too, really if he can say such what if the fresh graduates who get jobs and enter there, after a while they will also do so
12/05/2018, 07:15 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes , but u have allies
12/05/2018, 07:16 - +60 17-364 3269: The mentality comes about as reason of taking politics as employment , if he thought politics was just a by the way , then he would not have that mentality
12/05/2018, 07:16 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Well it’s not a lifetime employment, you looking at politics on one side of m7 u not looking at it as politics to everyone, the bias that u already having. Here am not looking at m7 am looking at politics in general
12/05/2018, 07:17 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: If you saying it’s lifetime employment where is amaama mbabazi
12/05/2018, 07:17 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Well my say is politics isn’t lifetime employment
12/05/2018, 07:17 - +60 17-364 3269: U r ur own critic the argument is Ugandan politicians take politics as employment , not that politics is employment
12/05/2018, 07:18 - +60 17-364 3269: Amama mbabazi , had a choice , . He could have stayed with m7 side , he would still be in parliament , he choose otherwise .
12/05/2018, 07:18 - +60 17-364 3269: It’s all about choice n decision
12/05/2018, 07:19 - +60 17-364 3269: N all choices have consequences
12/05/2018, 07:19 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Of cause politics is employment that’s why u paid. I don’t see any difference btn these statements cause your argument is Ugandans take politics as life time employment and am saying it’s No
12/05/2018, 07:19 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Wel now u on the same page with me “mentality of citizens” now do u get what mentality can do
12/05/2018, 07:20 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes ur right politics should not be taken as employment , but Ugandans do take it like that’s
12/05/2018, 07:20 - +60 17-364 3269: That
12/05/2018, 07:20 - +60 17-364 3269: Not just Ugandans , Africans in general
12/05/2018, 07:20 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Give me examples okay
12/05/2018, 07:20 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Leave presidents out
12/05/2018, 07:21 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Presidents who faught the war leave them out
12/05/2018, 07:21 - +60 17-364 3269: Yea n it toook Amama how many years to change his mentality .
12/05/2018, 07:22 - +60 17-364 3269: Y should I leave the presidents out , they r the ones who breed that mentality
12/05/2018, 07:23 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Cause that’s the only thing u gonna mention, but he can’t force you to change your mentality u also change cause u want something
12/05/2018, 07:23 - +60 17-364 3269: Look at the civil servants , police justice system , all u have to do is be on Museveni side n u will be employed forever as long as his president
12/05/2018, 07:23 - +60 17-364 3269: It’s not just the president
12/05/2018, 07:24 - +60 17-364 3269: Parliament ,’members of the nrm all of em
12/05/2018, 07:24 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Let me tell u, there is no or there few presidents who went to the bush to fight who have left power peacefully period, and I can assure you our president won’t leave power period. If I think there is anyone who can be a president give me examples
12/05/2018, 07:24 - +60 17-364 3269: Look wat happened during the age limit bill .
12/05/2018, 07:25 - +60 17-364 3269: Okay , so ur saying after m7 dies , uganda is doomed
12/05/2018, 07:25 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: That’s mentality and that’s why am saying even if it’s u who goes into the system u will forget and enjoy the money (reality)
12/05/2018, 07:25 - +60 17-364 3269: Without m7 the country can’t move
12/05/2018, 07:25 - +60 17-364 3269: The mentality is caused by taking politics as employment
12/05/2018, 07:26 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: These a not examples of individuals u taking things as a whole. Parliament don’t u see new faces in every parliament so how is being that lifetime employment the wha u saying
12/05/2018, 07:26 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: I asked a question to name for me the potential candidates that u think uganda has to be the right ones
12/05/2018, 07:27 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Of course if he dies uganda will still continue
12/05/2018, 07:27 - +60 17-364 3269: I have not been uganda for some time n I have forgotten some names , but I remember kiggunddu , the electoral commission leader has he worked ever since Museveni got into power
12/05/2018, 07:28 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: No wonder. U look at a smaller and not a bigger picture
12/05/2018, 07:29 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: We talking about parliament and u giving me an example out of parliament
12/05/2018, 07:29 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: I said this !!!!!!!
12/05/2018, 07:30 - +60 17-364 3269: Me I have told u wat I think is good for uganda , federal . Divide the country into regions n let the kings have certain amount of power in there kindoms , n those without kingdoms , have governors , n instead of a president we have a prime minister n control his power . That’s the best option for uganda in my opinion . Right now I don’t think there is a good candidate . Although bobi wine has good a mind he still has a lot to learn
12/05/2018, 07:31 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Good u know there is no candidate. Discussion closed, time to make money.
12/05/2018, 07:32 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Blessed day everyone
12/05/2018, 07:33 - +60 17-364 3269: I said people who work in parliament , I didn’t say members of parliament . There other people who work in parliament that r not necessarily members of parliament . They work there for years , bse the nrm government has been in power for years so there people get to work there for years . Let me get there names will send u a list
12/05/2018, 07:38 - +60 17-364 3269: Well this is exactly wat is wrong with uganda , all of u are here u have all studied n but none of u can have the guts to challenge the government , so it’s case closed bse the opposition is weak , are u trying to tell me that the whole uganda no one can come up n be president . This is wat is wrong with the young generation , we expect miracles to come from somewhere , it’s upto us to change our country , n right now bobi wine is doing something we should all be doing , taking part in our countries fate . M7 will die all those people who have power now will leave one day , n then it will be your turn . Wat will u say .???? .then . This young generation of Uganda is lazy n expects miracles . The way u have spoken is exactly wat is wrong with the country .
12/05/2018, 07:39 - +60 17-364 3269: America didn’t choose Hillary bse they were tired of the same thing , we could always choose bobi wine or any other person different from the usual n try n expect change
12/05/2018, 07:39 - +60 17-364 3269: Be part of the change don’t leave it to God alone .
12/05/2018, 07:40 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Not everyone is interested in politics, we can change our country in different things and angles. We all gifted differently
12/05/2018, 07:41 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes we can but right now we have to look at the political part of it , bse political instalbilty leads to economical intasbility , u can’t plan for more than 2 years bse u don’t know wat will happen then
12/05/2018, 07:42 - +60 17-364 3269: The economy can’t move without political stability
12/05/2018, 07:43 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Well for your information uganda is politically stable and economically stable and that’s why it’s among one of the top countries for investment

12/05/2018, 07:59 - +60 17-652 9845: Unemployment*
12/05/2018, 08:00 - +60 17-364 3269: Thank u very much
12/05/2018, 09:10 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Unemployment is everywhere in every country only depends on what percentage. Well Ugandans don’t want to really work or I can say they don’t really add value to the company (some Ugandans) all they want is be given a job and expect salary without working harder.
12/05/2018, 09:11 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: And well it’s true that however much that conditions there no ready jobs in uganda because we have few industries since most of our source of income comes from agricultural
12/05/2018, 09:11 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Kenya Nigeria Ghana all have many industries than Uganda
12/05/2018, 09:14 - +60 17-364 3269: Shallow argument , the reason y Ugandans don’t add value to the company is bse many of them are uneducated even those who r educated have poor work ethic bse work ethic bse they didn’t get the training they should get , in uganda u can buy a degree , u can get a job not bse u r qualified but bse u have a connection. Poor work ethic is cause by poor society arrangement . N education system .
12/05/2018, 09:15 - +60 17-364 3269: Uganda does have industries , they just don’t grow reason behind it , is poor work ethic n poor economic system
12/05/2018, 09:15 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: I can tell u uganda we developing even though own development is slow cause of too much corruption and bad planners of our country. The owino market u used to see before right now there smaller malls. Where there where  no roads I see beautiful nice clean roads. Where there where no traffic lights they are there. Well isn’t that development???
12/05/2018, 09:15 - +60 17-364 3269: Majority of Ugandans create there win businesses they just don’t grow
12/05/2018, 09:16 - +60 17-364 3269: Slow development  it takes 6 years to put traffic lights . There is being slow n there is being slaggish
12/05/2018, 09:16 - +60 17-364 3269: We r lagging behind
12/05/2018, 09:16 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: I didn’t say uganda has no industries I said it has lesser industries compared to the countries mentioned above
12/05/2018, 09:16 - +60 17-364 3269: We need faster development , or atleast steady development
12/05/2018, 09:17 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: How do u expect faster development when u have no enough budget. Tell me the budget of uganda per year
12/05/2018, 09:18 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Get that budget per year and do a plan as you the person then u will know why uganda is still behind and has slow development
12/05/2018, 09:18 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: U can’t compare a country whose budget a year is in billion dollars and a country that is in just a ka million dollars
12/05/2018, 09:19 - +60 17-364 3269: How about if we deal with one thing at a time , every year we give money to a different sector , that way after 5 years. We would have achieved something .
12/05/2018, 09:20 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes we can meke that ka million useful . For example you say year one it’s infrastructure . Year 2 it’s agriculture . Year 3 it’s education . Year 4 it’s medical system . Year 5 it’s economic strategy . If m7 has done this all his 30 years we would b somewhere
12/05/2018, 09:20 - +60 11-2803 7720: Big push theory vs Balanced growth theory 🤓🤓🤓🤓
12/05/2018, 09:21 - +44 7914 583339: But the ugandan budget is more than one million dollars.🤔

12/05/2018, 09:33 - Eria Kamya: I appreciate whatever has transpired here guys, thanks for your views. I just came back online 🙏🙏🙏🙏. I am however very disappointed with Michael. And I will comment later
12/05/2018, 09:35 - +44 7914 583339: We all know wherr Mikel falls...am dissapointed u are dissapointed..😂

12/05/2018, 11:07 - +60 11-2895 6258: Team kamoli 🤩🤣 some people should stop convincing themselves and face the reality regardless of where they belong🧐 thanks to those who understand that our country is in dilemma👏👏👏 but am disappointed to some peoples' statements.
12/05/2018, 11:11 - +60 11-2895 6258: If RM1 is 963ugsh yet Malaysians are saying that their money lost value someone should tell me what that means to us as well wishers of our country Uganda. Mind you we all love our country so much but enough is enough period👯‍♀👯‍♂
12/05/2018, 11:12 - +60 11-3637 6788: <Media omitted>
12/05/2018, 11:27 - Eria Kamya: *Just to comment on a few things according to the way I see them*

Uganda is developing and this is good. Recently, the new bridge in jinja was completed and it's the first of its kind in Africa. With this and many other developments, I appreciate my country's progress at whichever rate it is. 

However, how long did it take Idd Amin to make more developments than the ones M7 has made??  *Only 9 years*. Even when Michael knows very well that Amin who was a typical illiterate made such physical developments, he continues to say that in Uganda, no one else can manage the presidential role. Very sad!!! I wish you advise government to stop organising presidential elections because it means we are looking for dead among the living then. 

Also according to you, our only best options are the ones in parliament.  Being president doesn't require any special or natural abilities and no one should deceive you that M7 is a gift to Ugandans. I have have travelled the whole of Uganda and I know what M7 means outside the western region.

You said that the reality is once we get into government, then we change our minds. Allow me to remind you about Mandela. Who knew that after 25 yrs in prison, he would only lead for one term?? So before you generalise Ugandans you should know that we are not the same. It is only for those presidents who misuse their powers while in office that don't want to leave. 

Even America, one of the most complex countries to rule changes presidents and still moves forward. Those would be the countries to have the *so called leadership gifts of M7*. You said Trump came in to gain power and achieve his business interests. By saying this, it is as though you had forgotten that the maximum he can be in office is eight years. In fact that statement applies much more to M7 who clearly stated his objectives in an interview. He said he's working for his children and grandchildren. Such a person is the one who will never leave power because he knows what happened to Gaddafi's children even before he died and after he died. In fact I don't know how you interpreted his statement. You should also be reminded that for the first time in a while, Trump has been able to drop the unemployment rate to below 3% even in states where he was beaten. This shows you people who are not self centred but have come to rescue the economy. He has also succeeded restoring peace in the Korean peninsular. If this was Obama (a typical politicians with self interests) probably Korea would be like Libya or Egypt. 

About the mentality of Ugandans, Ugandans have a very good mentality. You just misrepresented us. They know what is happening and what is wrong as well. Also the mentality of Ugandan politicians to take politics as employment was borrowed from the president. That is why in Uganda you will hardly hear of anyone resigning. I only remember the former FUFA president who did so. But the politicians have been mentored by M7 to see politics as a form of employment. I hope you recently heard what Dr Tanga Odoi, the chairman electoral commission of NRM said. 

In Uganda, we have many presidential options starting from me, to the Parliament and outside of it. The only issue I have with the current political heads is that they might have developed hatred by this time. This worries me about such people because they might have lost their objectivity by now. But I am very positive and objective that we have many presidents suppressed in the country. 

It is only in Uganda that you will never hear about someone being fired for misconduct of office duty. They're simply reshuffled. Except for the unlucky ones who try to shake him from the seat. He recently got so angry and emotional and ended up revealing this at the Labour day celebrations. 

Uganda's economy is developing but naturally. There's little government effort in this. This I blame not only the president but much to do with the National Planning Authority. However it all goes back to him in one way or the other. If the economy was not a a bad one, then he would not move around giving people money. I hope you understand that the economy has much to do with people's income. 

I also need clarification if I am mistaken here. Malaysia's prime minister has already been sworn in if I am not wrong. If this was Uganda, it would be a national event in kololo spending tax payer's money.
12/05/2018, 11:41 - +60 11-2803 7720: 🤓
12/05/2018, 11:42 - +60 11-2895 6258: Tell them👏👏👏
12/05/2018, 12:16 - +60 17-364 3269: Thank you , and the sad thing is there very many people who think like him . Who keep voting for Museveni bse they say there is no other leader , as if m7 is uganda
12/05/2018, 12:19 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣 atleast for arsenal wenger, you would say he is meant for Arsenal given his name. But he is also stepping down peacefully.
12/05/2018, 12:19 - Eria Kamya: Arsene....
12/05/2018, 12:49 - +44 7914 583339: This message was deleted
12/05/2018, 12:49 - +44 7914 583339: Mikel is a living example of Museveni's brain wash on Ugandans.
12/05/2018, 12:50 - Eria Kamya: Please guys, when I compare Uganda with other countries such as USA or Rwanda, I don't compare them in terms of the national budget. I know this varies a lot. But I sometimes compare them in terms of policies made by presidents. Making Rwanda to be the most organised and clean country in Africa is just about presidential policies and sticking to them. Also making the country corruption-free had nothing to do with the national budget.  Dropping the unemployment rate in USA had nothing to do with the US budget. But just a policy change. Those of you have been UAE and other countries you can understand this. 

Someone had misunderstood me in this.
12/05/2018, 12:52 - +60 11-2803 7720: 😳😳😳😳
12/05/2018, 12:52 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
12/05/2018, 12:52 - +44 7914 583339: And he laughs
12/05/2018, 12:53 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Am team museveni 😂😂😂😂
12/05/2018, 12:53 - +44 7914 583339: i knew it from day one
12/05/2018, 12:54 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Perfect
12/05/2018, 12:54 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: If that’s what your little Brains tell u
12/05/2018, 12:54 - +44 7914 583339: 😂
12/05/2018, 13:05 - +60 11-2895 6258: Who cares, so all this has been on the team not the country
12/05/2018, 13:14 - Eria Kamya: Me too 😅😅😅😅😅
12/05/2018, 13:14 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Byona bikola nga somona
12/05/2018, 13:17 - +60 11-2895 6258: Regardless of the team we are affected with whatever is happening personally I don't have any time all I care about is the country's well being
12/05/2018, 13:22 - Eria Kamya: Btw I don't hate M7 for those of you who think I do and that I am biased. I have directly and substantially benefited from some of his programs. But he just hasn't done enough.
12/05/2018, 13:42 - +60 11-2895 6258: It's never enough, he is just doing what he thinks is enough and no one can do enough so don't blame him for not doing enough
12/05/2018, 13:44 - +60 11-2895 6258: Appreciating the little he has done is the best thing we can do than blaming him for what he hasn't done
12/05/2018, 13:45 - +60 11-3637 6788: What is the way forword. Can we make suggestions to our situation!
12/05/2018, 13:45 - Eria Kamya: We need a clear retirement plan for this guy
12/05/2018, 13:46 - Eria Kamya: That's where his worry lies
12/05/2018, 13:47 - +60 11-2895 6258: My dear there is absolutely nothing we can do at the  moment just sit back and watch, pray for a miracle from the Almighty that's all I can say
12/05/2018, 13:47 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
12/05/2018, 13:48 - +60 11-2895 6258: Clear retirement 🤩🤩 everyone must pay for his/her deeds even the bible/Quran talks about it
12/05/2018, 13:49 - +60 11-2895 6258: No one will run away from the hell fire everyone's deeds will one day get back it h/her
12/05/2018, 13:49 - Eria Kamya: Himself didn't sit back to relax in 1981. He went to the bush. Oba we also hire the expendables 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂
12/05/2018, 13:50 - +60 11-2895 6258: He didn't hire anyone you can join the Bush if you think it's the only way out
12/05/2018, 13:51 - +60 11-2895 6258: Why do you think he is worried if he didn't do anything wrong ??? I really need your ans here
12/05/2018, 13:53 - Eria Kamya: Of course he did many wrong things. That's why I advocate for a good retirement plan for him. Because he's scared
12/05/2018, 13:54 - +60 11-2895 6258: Why did he do them and if he did don't you think he knew the outcome let whoever did anything wrong face the outcome of it
12/05/2018, 13:55 - +60 11-2895 6258: Eria plz get serious there is absolutely no way you wrong and you just don't want to pay for your deeds you need to read your Bible
12/05/2018, 13:56 - Eria Kamya: We all sin knowing the outcomes. But if people re assure us about repentance, we change our minds
12/05/2018, 13:56 - +60 11-2895 6258: Or you can hire me as a Cuban teacher for your Bible classes
12/05/2018, 13:56 - +60 11-3637 6788: Let us suggest some tangable solutions. Our country still has many good things to rely on. You and me can do it.
12/05/2018, 13:57 - Eria Kamya: You're hired please. Come for your appointment letter
12/05/2018, 13:57 - +60 11-2895 6258: Moses mukwano clear retirement should not be part everyone must pay
12/05/2018, 13:57 - +60 11-2895 6258: Thanks
12/05/2018, 14:01 - Eria Kamya: You think there's any other means apart from a retirement plan??? 🤷🏻‍♂  Why do you think the Magezi's bill came at that time?? It's also another retirement plan but an *infinite retirement*  which the country didn't want. That's why I wished he had instead brought the safe retirement bill.
12/05/2018, 14:02 - +60 11-2895 6258: If he want to die in power it's okay just know that the country is going no where
12/05/2018, 14:03 - +60 11-2895 6258: Politics is a dirty game we just don't know what his plans are am just lucky that am not a politician
12/05/2018, 14:05 - +60 11-3637 6788: Dont loose hope. Malaysians did it. I hop there are lessons we have learnt. The party that had ruled for over 60yrs was defeated by one created hardly 3 yrs.
12/05/2018, 14:07 - +60 11-3637 6788: Make postive prayers for our leaders. Leaders are God chosen. Atleast not all is gone.
12/05/2018, 14:07 - +60 11-2895 6258: You're forgetting that here power belongs to the people but in Uganda power belongs to the president and if he is the head of everything how do you expect us to " did it" like Malaysia
12/05/2018, 14:08 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣If he dies in power, we might have serious chaos which he can prevent now because he a lot of influence and can lead a very good transition.
12/05/2018, 14:09 - +60 11-2895 6258: Leadership comes from God that I very well know so we just pray nothing else can be done and I believe he is watching
12/05/2018, 14:09 - Eria Kamya: This how God is often misunderstood
12/05/2018, 14:11 - Eria Kamya: Even rebels, thieves, have leaders. Do they also come from God? Kony was a rebel leader, so God appointed him??
12/05/2018, 14:12 - Nuruat Kobusinge: ....yes,...God can be misunderstood sometimes. You got to help yourself first,..& pray
12/05/2018, 14:13 - +60 11-2895 6258: Nur welcome on the platform
12/05/2018, 14:13 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤷🏻‍♂

12/05/2018, 14:16 - Eria Kamya: Thank you dia 😊
12/05/2018, 14:26 - +60 11-3637 6788: Is it our resolution that we only pray?
12/05/2018, 14:27 - Nuruat Kobusinge: Definitely not !
12/05/2018, 14:57 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
12/05/2018, 15:09 - Eria Kamya: So far we have three resolutions. 
1) To make a clear retirement plan. 
2) To sit back and relax 🤣
3) To pray for a miracle from heaven 
4) ..........
5  ..........
12/05/2018, 16:13 - +256 701 406572: Indeed good lessons like age is just a number. Uganda did well to scrap age limits like Malaysia.
12/05/2018, 16:20 - +60 11-2895 6258: David, it's obvious what else would I expect from you.

12/05/2018, 17:26 - +60 11-2895 6258: Banange plz don't take it on me I was just trying to defend him a little that's all
12/05/2018, 17:29 - +60 11-2895 6258: More blame should be on those people around him and some of us who have a mentality that if he leaves we can't get anyone to success him like as if he is the only one in Uganda
12/05/2018, 17:32 - +60 17-364 3269: Even u r among them , u don’t defend someone a little , ur either with them or against them , not in btn . So make up ur mind

12/05/2018, 18:59 - Eria Kamya: Kibaki was 87 years and wasn't willing to leave the seat. As a result, many people died and I hope you remember all that. What they did was to come up with a safe retirement plan for him and he went peacefully.  Now, Kenya is stable and presidential terms were restored.

14/05/2018, 10:43 - +60 17-364 3269: Lol
14/05/2018, 10:43 - +256 701 406572: 🙆🙆🙆
14/05/2018, 10:44 - +256 701 406572: Our Mzee has cattle farm and can't do such a thing. It's why he is popular. Najib really messed up
14/05/2018, 10:44 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: The man has been rich. I want to become a president walayi
14/05/2018, 10:45 - +60 17-364 3269: lol that’s y his popular , Museveni is owning property in South Africa , n his family
14/05/2018, 10:45 - +60 17-364 3269: U see , no wonder m7 is ur mentor . This is wat u want to do
14/05/2018, 10:46 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Give us proof please
14/05/2018, 10:47 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Even Najib is my mentor. Look at those bags of money and the gold. Nigga wanted to run away and he was captured. Very stupid of him why didn’t he give me some money to bring in ug
14/05/2018, 10:52 - +60 17-652 9845: It’s an old video apparently 🤦🏿‍♀
14/05/2018, 10:55 - +256 701 406572: No one knows how good M7 is till one day when he is out of office. "Basima Ogeze". Last year alone, he addressed students on military colleges of USA and UK. State House is always receiving military students from all over the world to get just one hour lecture on military strategy from Mzee. No African head of state commands such respect in military philosophy as Mzee. While in Malaysia, their military experts were only quoting M7 and Nasser of Egypt as Continental military strategist. It's reason for his long rule and wide impact in Rwanda, DRC, CAR, Sudan, Kenya, Somalia and now Equatorial Guinea. It's what makes me proud Ugandan despite these few challenges like urban crime which will be defeated soon
14/05/2018, 10:56 - +60 17-364 3269: Genda genda Eli
14/05/2018, 10:56 - +60 17-364 3269: Kati should be mass produce him n keep him from dying
14/05/2018, 10:56 - +60 17-364 3269: God
14/05/2018, 10:56 - +60 17-364 3269: I hate it stupid people who worship m7 ,
14/05/2018, 10:57 - +60 17-364 3269: A good leader gives others a chance to also become good leaders
14/05/2018, 10:57 - +60 17-364 3269: Stop making excuses
14/05/2018, 10:57 - +60 17-364 3269: No one says m7 is the worst president , we simply say there is nothing he can add to uganda anymore
14/05/2018, 10:58 - +60 17-364 3269: A simple fact
14/05/2018, 10:58 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: The army general is now talking. You true on the part of the army but truth is in uganda urban crimes will never stop when the police itself works with thieves. The entire police especially the top positions must be thrown out for police to have a clean name
14/05/2018, 10:59 - +60 17-364 3269: Start with the biggest thief himself
14/05/2018, 10:59 - +256 701 406572: Not worshipping but some generations produce strong leaders. How long did Dr Mahathir rule Malaysia? People got tired of him but missed him and have returned him. What of Singapore founding father? What of Putin of Russia? You like them or hate them, they are strong leaders my brother
14/05/2018, 11:00 - +60 17-364 3269: It’s wats make u proud of uganda , he is giving military strategy he can still do it while out of office
14/05/2018, 11:00 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: This is exactly my point. Mahathir rules for so long and people were tired of him and here he came back on opposition side and left his party
14/05/2018, 11:01 - +256 701 406572: I agree with you on this that some police officers are not helping enough. But I am hopeful we shall evolve and defeat these wrong barbaric elements murdering Ugandans
14/05/2018, 11:01 - +60 17-364 3269: No , at this point , we should bring back Idi Amin . That’s wat u should say
14/05/2018, 11:02 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: @256701406572 just leave that gentleman/lady she’s suffering from musevenism like me though am not that much affected
14/05/2018, 11:02 - +60 17-364 3269: The police is not helping bse they r not being paid , they don’t earn . So they work with the thieves to make extra
14/05/2018, 11:02 - +256 701 406572: 👏👏👏
14/05/2018, 11:02 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Bring him back if it’s possible. There is no African leader who came by gun and left power peacefully and don’t ever think muzeyi can leave peacefully never and I don’t think he can
14/05/2018, 11:03 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: The only discipline officials is the army that’s why I want to join the army please @256701406572 am coming soon as well
14/05/2018, 11:04 - +60 17-364 3269: And u seriously support this , . U support war every election . To build n destroy everything . Over n over bse we can’t get good leaders who have nothing to do with the gun
14/05/2018, 11:05 - +256 701 406572: Democracy of changing leaders regularly does not necessarily spur development. Tanzania is poor despite having regular change of leaders compared to countries like UAE who have never changed their Emir.
14/05/2018, 11:05 - +256 755 911999: the strength of a leader is measured by how many people he can skill and equip in order for a country,business, organisation even family to continue after he is gone. the fact that mzee has failed to pass on his excellent military strategies to anyone else shows what kind of leader he is. He is power hungry and desires to be the only solution to the problem. i believe that's why he has ridden on that peace manifesto for over 30 years now. people feel threatened they think after Sevo there will be no peace as if people just want to be there fighting. a good leader ensures continuity of  his business or organisation or country not break down of systems if his not available. we must have systems that work.
14/05/2018, 11:06 - +60 17-364 3269: Uganda n Tz are different kind of people . Uganda is more capable of being richer than Tz . But it’s our leaders that put us down
14/05/2018, 11:06 - +256 701 406572: Welcome my brother. We need to serve our country especially our generation
14/05/2018, 11:06 - +60 17-364 3269: Tz people r naturally dull people , Ugandans we have zeal , our country is capable of becoming powerful just like it was in the past
14/05/2018, 11:07 - +60 17-364 3269: Ur not going to serve ur country , ur going to serve m7
14/05/2018, 11:07 - +60 17-364 3269: There is no uganda , there is only m7
14/05/2018, 11:09 - +60 17-364 3269: Thank u , he uses that peace manisfeto every time . Ugandans should always work towards peace as a country not as a president . He manipulates people .
14/05/2018, 11:10 - +256 701 406572: Now you are spot on. I agree. UN wanted to transfer UN logistic base from Entebbe to Nairobi and M7 wrote just a  letter to UN General Secretary and everything was cancelled. Kenyans are crying. M7 influence goes beyond the region and works for his countrymen.
14/05/2018, 11:11 - +60 17-364 3269: And why do think the un wanted to change it . And what will happen wen he dies , then wat ???
14/05/2018, 11:12 - +256 701 406572: Mzee has groomed many leaders. Example is Kagame, Garang, all Uganda politicians including Besigye and Muntu. It's Mzee who spotted them and groomed them.
14/05/2018, 11:12 - +60 17-364 3269: M7 worshippers , u don’t understand , we do recognise m7 for the good things he has done . But he has over stayed his welcome .
14/05/2018, 11:13 - +60 17-364 3269: He has groomed many leaders outside Uganda , those in Uganda , have to worship him , otherwise he deals with em .
14/05/2018, 11:13 - +256 701 406572: New generation will naturally get a leader to handle new challenges
14/05/2018, 11:13 - +60 17-364 3269: Why do we have to wait for him to die
14/05/2018, 11:14 - +60 17-364 3269: Is uganda a kingdoms
14/05/2018, 11:14 - +60 17-364 3269: Kingdom
14/05/2018, 11:14 - +60 17-364 3269: Y don’t we have any alive president . To advise the people after them
14/05/2018, 11:14 - +256 701 406572: Not only outside Uganda. I gave example of Besigye and Muntu. Tell me any Ugandan politician not groomed by M7
14/05/2018, 11:14 - +60 17-364 3269: That is the problem with uganda , u have to die to leave power . Wat kind of transition is that
14/05/2018, 11:14 - +256 755 911999: so if he groomed them why then is he soo hesitant to pass on power?
14/05/2018, 11:15 - +60 11-2803 7720: Thank you Afande Watasa 
However, as much as we appreciate President Museveni as a General and respect him for his expertise in military philosophy, in my view, the world has changed and leaned more on economic policy and Human Resources development and poverty reduction strategies especially for the 3rd world.
As an economist, I believe strongly in the role the military plays in keeping the country safe but at the same time, I understand that keeping poor people safe is difficult because the characteristics of poverty are among them agitation and lack of self esteem as well as irresponsiblility. 
People with such characteristics are believed to be the primal cause of insecurity and when you have more of them? I leave that at that. 

Likewise, economic policy, has of recent become the key strategic area in global politics. Economic wars, trade and tariffs, and exports-Import volumes have become the new wars on top of cyber wars. 

Clearly, the world has shifted. Take an example of Malaysia. In the 1960 and wary 70’s, it was mulled by insurgent activities, civil uprising and all of that, the period for fighting was there until the government noticed that the way forward was Human Resources development which laid a firm foundation economic development. And that is what we are enjoying today. 

So, in my view, the GENERAL isn’t getting his priorities right. He is heavily investigating in sectors that were too much important in the early 1990’s and less in sectors that should be currently relevant. 
Together with poor policy implementation, and all other factors.
In my view, so long as Uganda remains a poor country, there will be insecurity. So the General should shift from being the good military strategist to a better Economic policy analyst and strategist. 
Or alternatively, let Uganda find another ideologist, because change comes with ideological shift, which is also important for the coming generations. 

I SIGN OUT
14/05/2018, 11:15 - +60 17-364 3269: I just told u , those in Uganda are groomed to worship him . Otherwise they r dealt with
14/05/2018, 11:17 - +60 17-364 3269: Great , exactly wat am trying to tell him , a country does not run on military any more , we need economic development as well
14/05/2018, 11:17 - +256 701 406572: But people and his party still love him and he will pass over power at appropriate time when his Party decides. Me and you we can only lament. It's not M7 problem but Party still loves him my brother. How can you force a man to divorce his wife?
14/05/2018, 11:17 - +60 17-364 3269: M7 does add economic value to the country
14/05/2018, 11:17 - +256 755 911999: did you know that so many of the people uve mentioned started out in sevoz corner but he started doing things the wrong way and wasnt willing to be corrected?
14/05/2018, 11:18 - +60 17-364 3269: People don’t love him , leave alone those chicken elections , were his cows vote . The people in nrm are cowards
14/05/2018, 11:18 - +256 782 688599: What will u say?
14/05/2018, 11:20 - +60 11-3637 6788: The wife is living in agony. If possible many ar ready to return dowry he paid.
14/05/2018, 11:21 - +256 755 911999: the party loves him coz he keeps their pockets deep. it would be foolish for a man to bite the hand that feeds him. Sevo knows how to manipulate people... those bu promotions envelopes manya wat u think these are things he just does? he also knows...n his said it before everybody has a price. if it wasnt the case i believe we wouldnt need voter bribery. look at what happened in Rukingiri before the women representative elections.... guy went and bathed guys with money... all for wat?
14/05/2018, 11:22 - +256 782 688599: My PhD economic scholar has summed it all
14/05/2018, 11:24 - +256 755 911999: word
14/05/2018, 11:30 - +256 701 406572: I totally agree with you brother Daaki. In 1960s and 70s,  military was strong arm and determined everything like military coups. Currently, it's NOT  army commander but Chief Justice and Speaker who determine who takes the day. Army Generals were powerless but only few men in court dressed as judges nullified Kenya elections! Speaker and his MPs if not sober are manipulated to change laws to suite any politician or party. Currently, economic sanctions destroys any state than military might of missiles. It's what has made North Korea accept dialogue and it's what will stop Iran nuclear power. But Mzee knows this well. He treats MPs and Judges different than Generals and Soldiers. More money is going to OWC,  NAADs,  Infrastructure like roads than defence. It's better to have good tarmac roads even if soldiers sleep in grass thatched houses. It's reason one MP salary pays all Uganda Generals!
14/05/2018, 11:32 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Thank you sir
14/05/2018, 11:33 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Don’t u see his son in the army. Don’t u see how he has built the best army across africa I can say.
14/05/2018, 11:35 - +60 17-364 3269: Wats the point with the army wen people r poor , n Ugandan is not the strongest army . It’s good year but not strong .
14/05/2018, 11:35 - +60 17-364 3269: Then let his son continue in the army , let the Dad get out of the presidential sit
14/05/2018, 11:36 - +60 17-364 3269: I keep asking u a question u don’t answer .
14/05/2018, 11:36 - +60 17-364 3269: Yea , but u can see Kenya , n how it’s democracy has helped it , n Tz is richer than Uganda
14/05/2018, 11:37 - +60 17-364 3269: So I don’t see , the point .
14/05/2018, 11:37 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Exactly just say that he has over ruled and should go away rather than saying he hasn’t developed anything
14/05/2018, 11:37 - +256 701 406572: OMG! UPDF is not strongest army? Where do you get facts? Give me any African Army strong than UPDF in Sub Sahara Africa? I know we are only behind Ethiopia
14/05/2018, 11:38 - +60 17-364 3269: I didn’t say he does did not do anything , I said he can no longer add value to the country . Simple . The problem is worshippers don’t listen .

14/05/2018, 11:40 - +60 17-364 3269: Uganda does have a good army
14/05/2018, 11:40 - +60 17-364 3269: But a poor economy , affectes the army as well
14/05/2018, 11:41 - +60 17-364 3269: No matter the skills , if the army does not have money to help it do its work then it can’t be powerful enough .
14/05/2018, 11:42 - +60 17-234 7760: He will never get it.. ama eat your slice as we pounder about the country that can me at per with malaysia
14/05/2018, 11:42 - +256 701 406572: I see your source which I also read. They base it on economy spent on military and are just promoting their defence equipment. But that's not how we measure military might
14/05/2018, 11:42 - +60 17-364 3269: Ur right ,it’s a waste of time arguing with him.
14/05/2018, 11:43 - +60 17-234 7760: Evelyn be positive still we change one man at a time.. dont lose hope..
14/05/2018, 11:44 - +60 17-364 3269: Are u crazy . Military power depends on skill n everything n defence equipment. Why do u think m7 would rather let u starve but wen the military is financed
14/05/2018, 11:44 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Let’s keep lamenting here but we all know this man can never hand over power. Some of us left the country in the hands of God to watch over us and pray we shouldn’t get another war
14/05/2018, 11:44 - +60 17-364 3269: I have not lost hope , I do love my country , but people who don’t get it , just interest me
14/05/2018, 11:44 - +256 755 911999: mbu dont you see his son and the updf seriously??? this is a country we are talking of not somebodys homestead it shouldnt be run as such.. thats why i said in the beginning we must have systems that work. not rely on emotional human beings.
14/05/2018, 11:45 - +60 17-364 3269: U prefer to b a coward than to face the problem . N u want to join the army .so sad , ur going to be part of the problem
14/05/2018, 11:45 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Do u know that a president ruling a country owns it like his own company or u didn’t know
14/05/2018, 11:45 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes , clearly nepotism
14/05/2018, 11:46 - +60 17-364 3269: Hmm presidents r not supposed to own a country it’s a not a kingdom it’s a republic , he can’t own it
14/05/2018, 11:46 - +60 17-364 3269: There is a problem with u .
14/05/2018, 11:46 - +60 17-364 3269: Anyway m7 is working in u
14/05/2018, 11:47 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: This group became political I wish it had started before leaving Malaysia we would be meeting up and discuss about these issues which is better than here on WhatsApp. I love and respect everyone’s idea it’s a way for us all to learn
14/05/2018, 11:47 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: That’s the subject u don’t understand
14/05/2018, 11:47 - +60 17-234 7760: I don’t believe that every man in uniform is in bed with the regime. But if a man sees that that was his only way of bread and he is thankful of not living in the gutters.. he will be thankful and defend the hand that feeds him/her
14/05/2018, 11:48 - +60 17-364 3269: It’s u does not undestand it , I don’t know wetha u know wat a republic means
14/05/2018, 11:48 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: If u remember m7 wanted to sell mabira and lake Victoria that means he owns a country like his own company although he can’t sell the entire country but he can sell anything the country has
14/05/2018, 11:49 - +60 17-364 3269: Wen u r in the uniform , u get orders from the regime , wetha u like it or not , that’s y those he didn’t like it , left
14/05/2018, 11:49 - +256 755 911999: Uganda is the pearl of Africa. No matter how much one steps on a pearl or tries to de value it, it is still precious. Lets get out of this government etuyambe plan and start helping the government. they have clearly failed so lets put our young energetic minds together and work for our motherland. watched a clip o a doctor who charges people plastic waste instead of money to get treatment in his hospital. He is helping the people and the environment. making money from recycling to fund the hospital. these are things we should be doing.
14/05/2018, 11:49 - +60 17-364 3269: That is exactly wat am telling , u , he is not supposed to own it . Uganda is not m7
14/05/2018, 11:49 - +60 17-234 7760: Thats the military my dear. U take orders but some have different views from the regime.
14/05/2018, 11:49 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: That’s why whites made blacks look like we should making up things to make us think we have them. Those niggas come to Africa and take everything to make their countries rich
14/05/2018, 11:51 - +256 701 406572: Not crazy my friend but you can't understand it. Let me give you one example. By Law, if a Kenyan soldier crosses Kenya border to operate in another country, he is paid allowance doubling his salary. Same with other countries except Uganda and Ethiopia. So Uganda can use small budget to sustain her forces in Sudan for example while Kenya will triple the budget even if similar personnel and equipment are used. It's reason UPDF has many outside deployments than any other African country. It's doctrine,  ideology not necessarily resources.
14/05/2018, 11:51 - +60 17-364 3269: Really , typical African stupidity , so ur going to justify the mistake of African leaders by abusing whites for slavery .
14/05/2018, 11:51 - +60 17-364 3269: That nice
14/05/2018, 11:52 - +60 17-364 3269: How about we invite China to take over . This is so dumb for u to say
14/05/2018, 11:52 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Without congo the largest country supplying tantalum that is used to make gadgets we wouldn’t be here lamenting or have any gadgets. But look at Congo is the most poorest country yet they have a mineral that is used to make gadgets like phones laptops. Really a white man has mad an african look stupid
14/05/2018, 11:53 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes , he uses the army to get money from international agencies . But where does that money go
14/05/2018, 11:53 - +60 17-364 3269: Has kony ever been found
14/05/2018, 11:54 - +256 701 406572: 👏👏👏
14/05/2018, 11:55 - +60 17-234 7760: @601128037720 you have been typing for a century🤷🏾‍♂
14/05/2018, 11:56 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Now u the kind of person I would love. U now have understood what your country needs. I vote u to be finance minister when I become president
14/05/2018, 11:56 - +60 17-364 3269: There u go again , blaming a white man for everything . Clearly I agree white people r evil , but black people have done nothing , to help our selves . I hate all the leaders who keep betraying us
14/05/2018, 11:56 - +256 701 406572: I am also waiting patiently for his insightful piece
14/05/2018, 11:56 - +60 17-364 3269: U love people to sweet talk u , I will tell u the fact ,
14/05/2018, 11:57 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Any good leader is killed by the same Africans look at Gadaffi really in a country where u get everything for free what else do u be needing
14/05/2018, 11:58 - +60 17-364 3269: Gadaffi was a plan by the nato , he was uniting Africa n they used rebels against him .
14/05/2018, 11:58 - +60 11-2803 7720: Thank you Afande Watasa and I well appreciate.
However, but There is no framework paper for operation wealth creation. 
On the failure of NAADs, but unlike NAADs that was welfare motivated, OWC is politically motivated and just by chance M7 leaves power, the entire thing will collapse. It’s foundation is just on words and pledges thus not a firm one. 

There is a process for implementing government welfare policy. 
First, it needs a policy framework paper with in which a SWOT analysis and feasibility study is done. The absence of such is why many policy programs in Uganda fail. 
Recall Prosperity for All (Bonna Bagagawale) a very good initiative, but no foundation, no framework, it collapses and they come back with SAcCOs, NAADs and Microfinance programs, They all failed. corruption, political interference and intrigue brought them down.

I am quite sure, poor people are not benefiting from OWC, the rich are scavenging on it. 

Like I said, Rather than petty initiatives, to get rid of such abject poverty in Uganda, HR development and Economic Policy implementation should be the key areas the General should focus. Lest, Uganda will remain in the poverty trap until the General leaves or dies in power.
14/05/2018, 11:58 - +60 17-364 3269: But no one wants to kill m7 , so he should do wat is right
14/05/2018, 11:59 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: U don’t have facts u a suffering from musevenism and with such people, we can’t have a discussion on the same table. U see besigye is hungry for poor and that’s why he has made his fdc party fail in everything. U see muntu is a man who would have leader fdc but look they all went against him. Stupid opposition
14/05/2018, 11:59 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: And who a the rebels (Africans my dear)
14/05/2018, 12:00 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: No one wants to kill him cause he is busy working with a white man. So how can he be killed
14/05/2018, 12:00 - +60 17-364 3269: Please explain wat musevenism means . And also I don’t see besiege as a leader we need .
14/05/2018, 12:00 - +60 17-364 3269: U know u just contradict ur self
14/05/2018, 12:00 - +60 11-2803 7720: I don’t just type, I analyse. 
Thank you Andrew
14/05/2018, 12:01 - +60 17-364 3269: U just blamed white people n but u support m7 who works with em . 😬😬😬😬😬😬
14/05/2018, 12:02 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes , they were Africans , who he was killing ,. Gaddafi was like Idi Amin.  Developing a nation at a cost of human lives , he used to kill people n they used that against him
14/05/2018, 12:02 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: It means people who are really tired of m7 being in power and all they need is kick his ass out and anything he does to them is bad however much  it’s good in reality. That’s what I call people suffering from musevenism
14/05/2018, 12:03 - +60 17-234 7760: @256701406572  i will pose this to u. One lovely quote had from one hon mp he said “ when m7 was my age he took up arms to kill people cause he saw things where not going right, at my age he just wants me to sit and watch my country go to the dogs “ 

What do u think of that statement?
14/05/2018, 12:03 - +60 17-364 3269: Ooooh , we don’t hate m7 from the first years of presidency , we hate m7 now , know the difference
14/05/2018, 12:03 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Every african leader kills anyone who is against him. Even if it’s me I will kill whoever is against me
14/05/2018, 12:04 - +60 17-364 3269: Spoken like a true m7 apprentice
14/05/2018, 12:04 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: But u all paired him when he came into power and expected good things and u the same people crying now. Naye abantu bazibu nyo
14/05/2018, 12:04 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Am speaking reality and truth and also you know well u can do that if u got a chance
14/05/2018, 12:06 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: I love @601128037720 ideologies u deserve to be in my government. Let’s all bring ideas on how to improve our country than blaming this old man who won’t leave power peacefully or any time soon
14/05/2018, 12:06 - +256 701 406572: You are spot on Daaki. I love your analysis. One day, when you jet in, I will request you address our OWC officers. I promise i can arrange. HR development as you said is key. If we can't do simple things, we can't manage big things. Otherwise thank you for all your positive ideas. Diaspore ideas always revolutionarise and improve local conditions.  May God bless you all
14/05/2018, 12:06 - +60 17-364 3269: I cannot kill someone who is against . I simply work n to output him or her , it’s about being smart . That’s y m7 has never killed besigye . Bse that will make him look bad , his peace manifesto won’t work anymore if he kills besigye , he simply tortured him , but not kill him , there is a reason y
14/05/2018, 12:06 - +60 17-234 7760: I think the way malaysians celebrated Dr M return is the same faith ugandans had in M7. We are just being optimistic. We never know what the future holds. But now ugandans know what and have seen.
14/05/2018, 12:07 - +60 17-364 3269: Uganda is not about to change , u people r even worse than m7 , the fact that u support him blindly .
14/05/2018, 12:07 - +60 17-364 3269: Is sickening
14/05/2018, 12:07 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: But besigye doesn’t work to work with m7 either way or sit on the same table. Some people don’t want peace they want force and kill u so where peace fails force (death) must be applied simple
14/05/2018, 12:07 - +60 17-364 3269: U have been optimistic for 30 years , for Christ sake
14/05/2018, 12:09 - +60 17-364 3269: By the way besigye n m7 have there issues . And every time some talks of m7 leaving power u think we want to replace him with besigye , but that’s not true . Both of em are an apple from the same tree , n that y he has not managed to defeat him .
14/05/2018, 12:10 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: And that’s why like before I don’t see any Potential President part from abed bwanika if u watched the presidential debate very well u know what am saying
14/05/2018, 12:11 - +256 755 911999: I voted for Bwanika
14/05/2018, 12:12 - +60 11-2803 7720: The future is us. You are the future and you deserve  the right to define the course of want to be. 
There is an African proverb that goes: 
*”Until the lions have their historians, tales of hunting will  always glorify the hunter”*
14/05/2018, 12:12 - +256 755 911999: But many Ugandans are blinded
14/05/2018, 12:12 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes I did
14/05/2018, 12:13 - +256 755 911999: Either by illiteracy, poverty,power hunger or all
14/05/2018, 12:13 - +256 755 911999: N now Sevo has confused villagers with land commission
14/05/2018, 12:13 - +60 17-364 3269: 😂😂😂😂😂
14/05/2018, 12:13 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Now u know whom to really vote for
14/05/2018, 12:14 - +60 17-364 3269: I really pity poor people , they r the poorest n they keep voting for him
14/05/2018, 12:14 - +60 17-364 3269: He keeps promising them staff
14/05/2018, 12:14 - +60 17-364 3269: Hmmmm
14/05/2018, 12:14 - +60 17-364 3269: So sad
14/05/2018, 12:15 - +256 701 406572: M7 took up arms coz there was no democracy and good constitution in place. Tribalism,  and nepotism was order of the day especially in military. Imagine you are in same uniform but kill a comrade coz of his tribe or religion. But currently, no need to pick up arms. We have elections and functioning democratic systems. We need to vote incompetent leaders out of office. In army, our morale is high not coz we are well paid but I know the institution values your competency not your tribe or religion. It's why I love UPDF. I could not serve in sectarian UNLA despite the pay package. Let each of us contribute to devt of country.
14/05/2018, 12:16 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Because they lack someone talking to them. M7 is very smart he gets his votes from villages and poor people while besigye only his strategy is to t towns where by most of the youth don’t vote but be lamenting. Really fdc and opposition need to wake up and visit villages. For example in my village kanyandahi I have never seen besigye there
14/05/2018, 12:16 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: That’s how the game of politics is to promise and never give in other words u need to be a good lair
14/05/2018, 12:17 - +256 701 406572: 😂😂😂
14/05/2018, 12:17 - +60 17-364 3269: I don’t know wetha ur blind u just choose not to see the reality , elections r flagged , nepotism is the order of the day , tribalims is the order of the day . The very things he fought are the very things he doing .
14/05/2018, 12:18 - +60 17-364 3269: They don’t have enough funds , to cover the campaigns like nrm does
14/05/2018, 12:18 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: To be honest on this I don’t see tribalism or nepotism in uganda
14/05/2018, 12:18 - +60 11-2803 7720: Evelyn, the entire country is poor. 
On top of limited access to wealth and resources, Poverty is explained as being in a state of powerlessness, low standards of living, disempowerment, poor education, poor quality of health services, and generally, lack of ideas. 

That makes 95% of Ugandans poor.
14/05/2018, 12:18 - +60 17-364 3269: N u support this
14/05/2018, 12:18 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Sadati fdc has enough funds Bro they even go ahead and collect from the people
14/05/2018, 12:19 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: There is no politican in this world who is honest therefore I support it 💯 but u need to lie smartly as u develop the country like kagame
14/05/2018, 12:19 - +60 17-364 3269: The fact that ur not even ashamed at all makes me wonder . Bse the people of luweero supported him but now he has forgotten him
14/05/2018, 12:19 - +60 17-364 3269: Them

Unfortunately, for NRM on top of diverting state resources to party funding, they also go ahead to request funds from Moguls in Uganda. 
I was part of a diner organised at Sheraton hotel that collected over Sha. 2Bn in cash and approximately Shs.12Bn in pledges to fund a proposed NRM towers in the land next to Crested towers.

14/05/2018, 15:37 - Eria Kamya: *Once again, thank you for your views.*

The truth is that we're in a mess. Regardless of how we get out of it, we must get out of it. 

Sadat was very clear. We don't need a strong military to solve our problems. We are no longer fighting military wars. Every time soldiers die in Somalia, there's a confusion about the number of how many died. This means some people are eating money. I recently posted a link where Gen Sejusa talked about corruption in the army. So the army itself is a problem. Just to take you back to the link. Sejusa said that they once carried out an audit in the army. At that time, they knew that the army was around 60,000 soldiers. But the audit revealed that the actual number was 23,000 soldiers. Therefore salaries of over 40,000 soldiers was always being paid out to ghost soldiers accounts. 

So that army itself is a disgrace and has been infiltrated by corruption. And besides, who are we going to fight??  When war comes, the army won't help given that now we have oil. Some countries with their interests will always come in the name of helping. That's why I never advocate for war because they can't help much. The police is already beyond worse. 

The OWC was created without a framework but that's not it's major problem. I say this with experience. The whole problem is corruption. It was also partially a way of keeping soldiers busy especially the retiring group. 

Someone talked about Malaysians missing Dr Muhatir and that's why they voted him back. And further concluded that we too might miss M7. How sure are you that we shall miss him before testing it?  What if we instead regret for not having pushed him out earlier? And if we miss him, then no worries we shall recall him. 

It is also very unfortunate that some of you always say he is not bad but those around him. Me I will always blame him individually. Those who are against this should first give me their views on this. *What does going out to political rallies with bags of money mean?*  I thought this broad-day corruption from the president. He is even willing to do it on behalf of other people (NRM  candidates). And what does it mean for the young generation??  It is clear that he himself actively and practically advocates for corruption.  So if the president does it then why not other government officials??  That's why for this reason among others, I blame him alone. He is a living practical example of corruption. 


No one likes war and we are neither advocating for it. But he's pushing us to that end. Every Ugandan wants a peaceful transition. But the hopes are dying out day by day. That's why for me I advocate for a peaceful retirement arrangement. Otherwise we shall continue into the most undesirable direction ever. 

*Thank you all for your views. It's better this way for our nation.*

14/05/2018, 18:37 - +60 11-2803 7720: I earlier talked about this. 
And now, minutes later, an article comes out in the daily monitor. 
OWC is politically motivated. 
In it, there is a spirit but no soul. It’s meant to be a welfare improvement initiative but its implementation makes it a populist policy.
It has no framework on which it’s based and in which it operates, no feasibility studies, no experts in crop husbandry or animal husbandry. 
Much of the soldiers employed do not understand agriculture systems and what so. 
We shouldn’t bother asking for OWC’s budget and expenditure. 

In the true explanation, the General’s policy is good. It’s vision and mission are excellent, but the implementation is ragged and was hijacked by vultures. 

Let’s keep praying.
14/05/2018, 19:13 - Eria Kamya: Thank you Sadat. 

Soldiers not technically knowing what agriculture is may not be a big issue, though it is an issue too. Agriculture is not complex and many Ugandans grow up practicing it. Therefore naturally, basic agricultural information is always known to farmers and our soldiers as well. Furthermore, each subcounty in Uganda has an agricultural officer or extension worker. These are responsible for guiding farmers where necessary. But the major issue is corruption. 

Another issue is that many farmers don't have enough money to care for the agricultural inputs. These inputs require frequent spraying which many can't afford. When it comes to animals it becomes worse. Agriculture of such kind only favours the rich who can afford to invest heavily in order to get good harvests. Many poor farmers want to get the good yields but fail along the way. Agriculture of this era is for the rich since even the climate has changed and much of the land is no longer fertile. 

But back to the government officials like the district production officers, agricultural officers, some CAOs, Naads officials, etc and now the soldiers have messed up the whole thing with corruption in many ways I can't reveal here.
14/05/2018, 19:29 - +60 11-2803 7720: Thank you for this wonderful response Mr. Kamya Eria.
Allow me to disagree with you on a few issues. 
Contrary to what we know, subsistence agriculture is not sufficient to take people out of poverty. A welfare program like OWC should come with proper *Agriculture extension services.*
To mention but a few;
-knowledge about better or improved seed varieties and best soils and seasons for cultivation.
- Knowledge about agribusiness eg. Value addition, storage, preservation etc
- better farming methods compared to rudimentary means used by most farmers.

These are the key areas that can help the poor get out of poverty and they need expertise. Not just the traditional knowledge we grew up with. 
I’ll give you a good example. A friend of mine was given rice seeds. the guy Was given seeds for *Upland Rice* instead of the rain fed wetlands rice. After planting the rice in a wetland and it didn’t yield. 
This is just an example of why we need Agriculture extension services. 
These experts. 
Secondly, the period of post harvest handling is very important. Both experts in these are needed to aid farmers with knowledge from agribusiness experts on value addition and proper storage. 

Remember, this is meant to creat wealth, not to provide subsistence agriculture
14/05/2018, 19:47 - Eria Kamya: Great from you Mr Sadat.

 Corruption has taken up every section of the country. Of course the planning was very poor from the beginning. But corruption has accelerated the failure of OWC. I will give you a simple example. Extension services are provided but as you know Ugandan officials, what they bid is not what they pass to the societies and no one follows up because they are all involved. Some areas even have demonstration farms but those will not fund farmers when it comes to purchasing fertilisers etc. Workshops are also organised for farmers by the government to sensitise them. For a serious farmer, already what the government has done is enough. But poverty coupled with laziness and also steered by corruption has failed the programme. 

On different occasions, some farmers have rejected inputs because they can't sustain looking after them.

16/05/2018, 14:16 - +60 16-475 8556: Thank you Trump.SAME SEX MARRIAGE...This interesting prayer was given in Kansas, USA, at the opening session of their Senate. Itseems prayer still upsets some people.When Minister Joe Wright was asked to open the new session of the Kansas Senate, everyone was expecting the usual generalities,but this is what they heard:"Heavenly Father, we come before you today to ask your forgiveness and to seek your direction and guidance. We know Your Word says: "Woe to those who call evil good", but that is exactly what we have done.* We have lost our spiritual equilibrium and reversed our values.* We have ridiculed the absolute truth of Your Word and called it Pluralism.* We have worshipped other gods and called it multiculturalism.* We have endorsed perversion and called it alternative lifestyle.* We have exploited the poor and called it the lottery.* We have rewarded laziness and called it welfare.* We have killed our unborn and called it choice.* We have shot abortionists and called it justifiable.* We have neglected to discipline our children and called it building self-esteem.* We have abused power and called it politics.* We have embezzled public funds and called it essential expenses.* We have insitutionalised bribery and called it sweets of office.* We have coveted our neighbor's possessions and called it ambition.*We have polluted the air with profanity and pornography and called it freedom of expression.* We have ridiculed the time-honored values of our forefathers and called it enlightenment.Search us, Oh GOD, and know our hearts today; cleanse us from every sin and set us free. Amen!"The response was immediate. A number of legislators walked out during the prayer in protest.In 6 short weeks, Central Christian Church, where Rev. Wright is pastor, logged more than 5,000 phone calls with only 47 of those callsresponding negatively.  The church is now receiving international requests for copies ofthis prayer from India, Africa and Korea.With the LORD'S help, may this prayer sweep over our nation and WHOLEHEARTEDLY become our desire so that we again can becalled "ONE NATION UNDER GOD."Think about this: If you forward this prayer to everyone on your list, in less than 30 days it would be heard by the world. How many peopleon your list will not receive this prayer.Do you have the boldness to pass it on?I HAVE, AND I HAVE JUST SHOWN IT BY FORWARDING THIS TO YOU. GO ON FORWARD IT!!!Proof : https://youtu.be/F-0exrd8D24

*I however strongly disagree with Lumumba.* This my submission in this regard. 

There's no way we can blame the west for our own problems. It's rather own past mistakes which we have not learnt from. All the developed countries have history and we always study about them as you know Uganda's syllabus. These countries had a lot of problems but worked hard to get from them. The problem with Africa is Africans themselves and of course, starting with the leaders. 

If you don't have a car and your neighbour has one, and you also can't afford fuel in case he asks you to provide, then be prepared to follow his rules. How would you expect him to give you his fueled car and also follow your schedule? It's you who should fit in his.  This is exactly Africa's problem. We have positioned ourselves in a begging mode. Yet we have a lot. So we should expect other countries to feast on us otherwise they can't help us and at the same time be our subjects!!! This is mere logic. 

For the past five or so decades, Africa has not been stable at all. All our resources have been wasted on political stabilisation. How far would we be had they been channeled into developmental things??   You look at a country like DR Congo, being listed among the poorest countries in the world!!!  This is ridiculous. Yet some desert countries like Qatar, UAE are very rich. Of course I know they have oil. But how many minerals remain untapped in Congo on top of the good climate??  

Instead of these speakers blaming our past and current leaders for their greed, they are transferring blame to third parties. It was greed from day one. Our nationalists fought hard to make us independent. But there was driving force of greed in them. Because ever since the whites left, we have exposed our helplessness without them. Why then did we chase them away!? Because believe me or not, there's no way they would interfere if we exhibited total independence after their departure. We were in fact not ready to take control of ourselves because we have proved this. We just got excited but later reality set in. 

We have been fighting ourselves since independence and end up running to them for military support. You expect them to help for free??? We are the ones inviting neo-colonialism. 

Lumumba actually said that the former US president, Reagan said the United States works for their own interests. This is funny!  So does Uganda work for Kenya's interests??  Everyone works for their own interests until a trade-off is inevitable. Unfortunately, here in Africa, these interests have been made personal by leaders. 

*That's my view* 🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂

26/05/2018, 16:44 - +60 11-2895 6258: MARRIAGE IS NOT FOR SMALL BOYS! !!!!!!
I used to interpret the saying "Marriage is not for small boys" to mean small  boys in terms of age, until I visited a female mentor that has been in marriage for 47 years.

I asked, so what is the secret of your over 47 years in marriage? 
Beaming, she retorted; My son, the expectations you bring into marriage will either spell its doom or success. I married my husband without expectations of enjoying his money or buying cars for me, but with time, my patience, hard work and God-fearing attitude yielded results of getting cars, houses, taking care of our children and all that. 

You see, if a married lady keeps on nagging in the house, she pushes the spirit of her husband from the home. If you make the man unhappy, you make the house uncomfortable.

So, I married without high expectations from my husband but simply to make him happy always. 

Yes, for the past 47 years, I would be the first to get up from bed and the last to go back to bed. I bath the kids, do devotions with them, prepare breakfast for my husband and boil hot water for him to bath. I iron his clothes he would take to work, kiss him and wish him the best in his daily endeavours. 

I asked my old woman, so then what does the man do in return? She laughed all heart and hearty and replied; You see, this is the mistake you young ones make in marriage. 
YOU DO SOMETHING FOR YOUR HUSBAND OR WIFE AND EXPECT SAME REWARD FROM HIM OR HER, THIS IS WRONG!

When it becomes your attitude to only please your husband or wife always, the other person responds naturally. Indeed, if nothing touches the palm tree, it doesn't rattle. 

She continued, my son, never carry "how rich or poor your family is" into marriage. After all, you knew very well the status of your family and decided to marry that man or woman. 

Love only compels/leads would-be couples into marriage but it doesn't sustain marriage. Rather, understanding, patience, communication and most importantly, forgiveness sustain every marriage. High expectations are the symptoms of divorce in marriages.
 
Sometimes you hear, I want to marry a mother, a business partner, God fearing person etc. You cannot get all your expectations in one person. With time and depending on your relationship, you may get some. So minimise your expectations in marriage. 

To cut the long story short, as too many cooks spoil the broth, she concluded on the mistakes a couple should resist at all cost in marriage:

1) Never say you have made your wife or husband somebody from a nobody. It hurts. God only used you as an agent for transformation, give the glory to God. 

2) Let the man be head of the home no matter the financial, economic, physical and emotional health situation prevailing in the couple's life whilst the woman exercises diligence in the use of the tongue. 

3) Having children should not be the ultimate objective in marriage. They are given to enhance your marriage. When God delays in giving you a child, have every reason to live a happy marital life.

4) Sex is a major morale booster after a hard day's stressful life. Try to be sexual beings and not "Angels" in that marriage

5) Resort to God often and less to men to solve your marital disputes. 

6) Let the women " Make up" their characters much more than they make up their body. 

Indeed, marriage is not for small boys because small boys struggle to forgive, demand everything speedily, lack the patience to wait, have so many friends etc.

Make every effort to let that marriage work and may God help us.

Kindly Share to Bless Others

28/05/2018, 21:41 - +256 755 911999: THE CHURCH CLEANER. 

 She is always in Church, wearing faded jeans, an old T-shirt and slippers to clean and arrange the seats, decorate and clean the pulpit whenever it is dirty.

For six years, she never missed a single Saturday coming to clean the Church.

One Saturday, a young man walked into the Church while she was still arranging the chairs. He went and sat down watching as the lady was  working.

He was impressed that a lady who looked quite beautiful even in the old clothes and a scarf over her hair could be so dedicated to her work in Church. He thought within himself that this was an unfortunate lady who probably had no one take care of her schooling and could probably be an orange seller or some petty trader struggling to make ends meet at the market stall. He watched and within his heart felt he knew what God wanted him to do. When he had felt a compulsion to come very early to Church, he had not understood but now he thought he did.

He went back to his car and took out money notes. When the lady finished her work and was about leaving, he called her and commended her for her service and gave her the notes.

She respectfully declined the notes but he insisted pressing it into her hands. He asked if she lived close so he could go drop her.

She thanked him and told him that her car was outside, but he did not understand what she had just said. He walked her out determined to find out all he could about this lady that God wanted him to help change her level.

They walked out of the Church with him telling her where he worked and how God had asked him to come early to Church that day and how he believed God is directing him to help make a big difference in her life. He was so busy talking he had not realized they had walked directly to a BMW X6 2017 limited Edition parked under trees in the parking lot.

The car made his one year old Benz look like a worn out wheelbarrow.

The lady opened the driver’s door stepped in and handed over her card to the man and said, “I believe God sent you here for a purpose, but I do not think it was to change my level, most likely it was to change yours.”

I am tempted to say it took a forklift to shut the young man's mouth and move him from the place he was glued to as the lady drove off. God had a purpose for bringing him to Church that morning and that purpose was to teach him humility which he learned well.

Many times we think so highly of ourselves that where God sends us to learn we go trying to teach.  We always imagine ourselves as teachers, never as students.

Oh, teach us to be humble, Lord.

02/06/2018, 02:10 - +60 11-2803 7720: _______________________________________________

Some may disregard the context in which I consider myself successful, but it is the reality. I AM.  Unlike many, I have established indicators to my success and lowered their standards to make myself feel privileged and happy.

From the day I opened my first bank account, I knew I had to build my career and my savings too, without the benefit of being handed anything.

Key to this was learning to live without all the things that I thought I needed. It ignited the focus and motivation to earn success without hoping on anything being handed to me.

I know, It is difficult for people to acknowledge the privileges they do have even when there are so many ways in which they don’t feel privileged. But the truth is that where I come from,  to many, LIFE often means starting from scratch. You are required to build your own WORLD from your own connections to form a network and establish your own reputation.

You cannot rely on nepotism or being hired by a generation of contacts, let alone your family. It is common sense that in may ways, the less privileged have to work twice as hard as those who were born into the luxury of privilege. 

The reason why the concept of privilege is so hard to debate in our society is because many individuals have no sense of their own privilege. Growing up privileged to many comes with a double-edged sword but when you spend your life building something from nothing, motivation becomes the key ingredient to success and nothing in your life is taken for granted.

However, privilege does not have to be associated with guilt, so long as we understand that it is important to give back. The fear of growing up without can be just as strong as the ramifications of growing up with everything handed to you.

That is why I strongly think that children who come from money should be taught that the path to privilege is a difficult road so they learn the value of what they have.

It all comes down to the responsibility every family has to raise young women and men who are acutely aware of their own privilege, and will always strive to use their resources to strengthen and support others in the community.

Audrey Hepburn is famous for saying that we have two hands in life: one for supporting ourselves, and one for reaching back and helping others, without expectation.

Because at the end of the day, privilege means nothing in this world if you can’t do something useful with it.

WHAT IS YOUR PRIVILEGE? And HOW ARE YOU USING IT? 

Please note: I found this Article on the Internet. I edited the article but most important, I included sections that I felt are important for young men and women.

When I think of the depth of the tomb and the pounds of sand that will be thrown at us, no need to hurt my brother;
When I think of the darkness that will invade the grave after the closing, no need to harm my sister;
When I think of the heat repressed by the soil and the amount of water that will drown me during the rains in this tomb, I can not make my neighbor suffer;
When I think that I will be alone abandoned by all, I prefer to enjoy communion when I am alive;
When I think that my relationships are mowed by my past, I wish to perfect my future;
 If I could be reborn to resume everything from scratch, I would not make mistakes in my actions.
Because after a long meditation I understood that All is vanity on earth *
May God help us to cultivate humility and the love of neighbor because vanity vanities, all is vanity.
Good meditation

09/06/2018, 20:19 - +256 701 406572: So sad to witness assassination of another senior citizen. Evil will never defeat good and darkness will never defeat light. These Killers will one day be arrested but even if not,  God will judge them. In 1970s and 80s, we had state sponsored killings. Now, it's opposite - Gangs killing prominent people in govt. But we shall raise above fear and rebuild our nation. These are cowards who fear even to publicise their motives of killings. RIP Abiriga, our gallant son.
09/06/2018, 21:17 - +60 11-2803 7720: Dear Afande Watasa,
Allow me to grieve with you for the loss of two of your comrades and a senior citizen as well as a legislator. 
On the other hand, allow me to differ with what you said. 
Given the precision and keenness with which the killings are being executed, I am skeptical of them being gang related. 
To me, these seem like well trained professionals performing on the roles they were trained for. 
I may not be an investigator, but it doesn’t take one to notice that these hitmen do not miss the target. They know exactly where to hit kill on scene. 

I really doubt gangs have the luxury to shower someone with all those bullets. And that’s why I think, there is more to these killings and hitmen than just gangs.
09/06/2018, 21:27 - +256 701 406572: You are correct in analysis that they are trained professionals with wrong motives. The problem is that it's hard to know their network and motives since they don't give us their motives. It shows that they are morally wrong. One thing I love from this government is it does not believe in assassination of opponents since bush war period. I am proud of serving a morally professional force. Too bad to shed innocent blood as all your generation up to fourth will pay for it. Thanks Bro for your analysis and we all sympathise with Abiriga family and constituents.

09/06/2018, 21:44 - +60 11-2803 7720: This  may not be foul play per se, but intrigue. 

Him being a Colonel, I think he landed on Dangerous information and was willing to pass it over to the Apex.  As a soldier, I am very sure that Afande you know the value of information and what it can do. 


Alternatively, Sometimes, politicians usually use sabotage through such dubious means to demean the government. 
I have read Ugandan history and this was a tool used by political hopefuls with in the regime and other external forces staying in Kenya and Tanzania during the period between 1971 -79. Actually, Ottunu and the late Kategaya have provided testimony to this. 
So, this can also come from political hopefuls sending signals. 

I am however looking at the gun-down of Abiriga as an assignment and pretty sure, someone did it to perfection. 

However, the question is: 
For the last Four years, a *PROMINENT MUSLIM* has died during *RAMADAN.*
Either of poisoning or gun related killings. I am still wondering WHY???? 
Because I don’t find it coincidental 🤔🤔🤔

Dear Lord and Father of mankind, forgive Uganda and its people.
Lord of mercy, Your Nation Uganda is in tears and fear. Bloodshed is taking toll, accidents, kidnap, rape and murder have become our identity as a nation. King of kings, take over this nation and lead it Yourself.
Forgive us of our iniquities.  We repent on behalf of our spiritual, political and cultural leaders, our forefathers, our families and on our own behalf. 
Blessed is a Nation whose Lord is God. What is happening  now in our country shows clearly that we have run away from You, forgive us O Father. We come before You with broken hearts, Lord only You can put an end to all these, only You can intervene, only You can revenge, only You have the answer to all these happenings.
The blood that was shed at Golgotha is more precious and can wash away all this other blood because Lord we know blood calls for blood.
Father heal our Land Uganda.
In the name of Your precious son Jesus Christ I have prayed
Amen. 
Circulate this prayer as we pray for our country Uganda.

10/06/2018, 19:02 - +60 11-2803 7720: Afande, 
It’s sad and Unfortunate that our beautiful country cannot adopt such guidelines. 
Musisi tried to implement guidelines to streamline boda boda operations in Uganda, there was a lot of resistance from most state establishments. 
In 2014, I remember Musisi proposed that all boda boda riders should be registered and also wear identification and reflective jackets with their identification numbers.

I recall a General who sabotaged the entire thing and insisted that Boda boda 2010 should be in charge. Musisi was forced into tapping out and guess what, nothing has ever been said again.
10/06/2018, 19:09 - +60 16-475 8556: True man...even carrying more than one person was prohibited but again masses pleaded what of sch kids? What of a mother and her kid finally it went un done
10/06/2018, 19:13 - +256 701 406572: You are correct my brother. Musisi was let down coz we lack the will to implement our policies. I remember when UPE has just begun, schools wanted parents to contribute to feeding but govt directed RDCs to arrest any headteacher charging food fees. Now Minister for Education is on national tour sensitising Ugandans to feed their kids. We need to improve on implementation of policies.
10/06/2018, 19:16 - +60 16-475 8556: Ya but I think we lack national thinkers and planners as a country which is so tedious for the govt to run everything

10/06/2018, 19:17 - +60 16-475 8556: If there then they are tired coz I think you have to plan ahead according to the increasing population generation and technology
10/06/2018, 19:17 - +256 701 406572: If you watch Hitler's documentaries, many assassination attempts were planned but never materialised. Reason was only ONE: Assassins knew could execute the plan but would also be killed or arrested. Meaning there was no exit strategy. To improve security, all measures need to be supported especially regulating transport sector. You can't talk of big things like surveillance if we can't handle small things of regulating Boda Boda. You can't  talk of exporting beef to Middle East if butchers locally use chemicals to preserve meat. You can't benefit from Highways if Taxis and Bodas do not respect traffic rules. You can't preserve wetlands and environment if we can't ban buvera. You can't have best universities if some districts like Amudat do not have first grade in PLE. My humble request is let us do small things first and big things will come automatically. Security is vigilance of all citizens not security forces alone. Terrorists causing fear is just temporary but will not affect our way of life. Uganda's progress is unstoppable

10/06/2018, 22:32 - +256 701 406572: FROM PRESIDENT MUSEVENI TO FREEDOM LOVERS AND PAN-AFRICANISTS

Sunday 10th June 2018

Again, I express my deepest felt condolences for the peace-lover, Hon Ibrahim Abiriga, killed by criminals on Friday evening. As the investigations are still going on, we cannot rule out personal motives for the murder. However, there is high probability that this killing was a political assassination because of his commitment to the NRM. If that is the case, the killers have miscalculated and shown their bankruptcy. Why kill somebody because you do not agree with him? Why don't you defeat his ideas with your "better" ideas?

Assassination means that you are already defeated. Your ideas cannot compete with ideas of the victim in terms of development. That is why you decide to kill him or her. That will not help you. Others with the same ideas will continue. 

However, assassination never saves the dictators from their doom. The assassinations of Dr. Mondlane and Samora Machel , did not save the Portuguese from total defeat. The assassinations of Herbert Chitepo, Ruth First etc, never saved the criminals of White South Africa and Rhodesia from their eventual defeat. 

Amin, by killing Ben Kiwanuka, Bataringaya, Bananuka, Balufuywa, Major Katabarwa etc could not save himself from his eventual defeat. 

When the NRM had taken power, some anti-democracy elements targeted and killed the first elected RCs/ LCs, especially in Busia and Teso to stop the people from joining the RCs/LCs. Scores of LC chairmen in Busia and Teso were killed. This, however, could not stop the defeat of FOBA (Force Obote Back - a group of some of the UPC supporters) from defeat. 

Kony and ADF were famous for attacking  soft targets - unarmed or unprepared people -rather than attacking military barracks or convoys. This did not stop Kony and ADF from being defeated. 

Assassins are cowards. They attack soft targets. They do not attack military targets which is the work of the brave. That is why they are called terrorists. We defeated all the terrorists in the rural areas: Kony, ADF, UPA, FOBA, Itongwa, the Karimojong cattle rustlers, etc. That is why there cannot be a revival of terrorism by criminals using the forests or the bush. 

How about the killings in the towns in recent times? Taking advantage of the huge success by the Ugandans of buying more cars, more boda bodas, building more hotels, building more shops and trading centres, and building more houses and having large numbers of our people in the towns, since 2012, they started on a series of killings and now more recently, kidnappings. 

Initially, the Police used the old Police methods of relying on eye witnesses etc. The criminals are using simple techniques to defeat this. They use jacket hoods (kwebika ku mutwe), not to be seen properly. They also bend the registration plates of the "pikipikis" so that they are not properly read. 

Due to the laxity in UCC, there was also the problem of people owning phones with false names. 

The criminals take advantage of large numbers of cars, boda bodas, mobile phones and people, to do bad things and escape rapidly without being identified clearly and quickly using the old methods. That is why, following the killing of Kaweesi, which came following the killing of the Moslem Sheikhs, Joan Kagezi etc, I ordered to put emphasis on upgrading our technical means of monitoring crime in the towns and along the highways. Having to buy these items from outside takes time. Nevertheless, we are now moving. 

The following are the technical solutions we shall acquire to monitor crime in the whole country, starting with the towns: 

1. Cameras, mounted along the streets and highways, assisted by cameras by individuals, at their own cost, on their business premises and homes;

2. Improved forensic capacity of the police; 

3. Electronically monitored devices mounted on all cars, other auto-mobiles, boda bodas, that are not removable from the platform that will help us to know where a particular vehicle was at a particular time; this will be done by vehicle owners at their own cost; and 

4. Other technical means that I do not want to go in here. 

We had delayed to go into acquiring these capabilities because of doing other priorities, especially: Defence , the roads, electricity, schools, health and the ICT backbone. Everybody can see what has been done. Since , however, we are now forced by criminals, we have already started diverting reasonable chunks of money to close this gap in the anti-crime infrastructure. We shall defeat these criminals in the towns as we defeated the others in the Bush. If it is ADF doing it, we shall do something about it. If it is other groups, we definitely will cater for that also. 

Our society has enjoyed a lot of freedom and a laxed way of life: trans-nights, drinking at all hours, gambling, freely bringing money and taking it out, preaching everything and everywhere, travelling out of and into the country, writing and broadcasting everything and everywhere, etc etc. 

Some people tell me that NRM should be stricter and try to regiment the country more. I have never been entirely convinced about this line of thinking. I prefer to teach by example rather than coercion. I prefer relying on the Policeman of the mind rather than the Policeman of the body, except for criminals. 

Now, the criminals think that they can use this freedom to undermine and discredit the NRM. They are wrong. The NRM has got a lot of capacity. I only need focus from our MPs so that we budget adequately for the anti-crime infrastructure and for wealth and job creation ahead of consumption and administration. 
 
The killers of Joan Kagezi, the Sheikhs, Kaweesi, Susan Magara and now, Abiriga, will then be defeated wherever they are. They have doomed their future by voluntarily putting themselves in the same category as Kony and the like. Their future is doomed. We need to just expose them and punish them. 

Again on the assassins, pigs, cowards. Can these pigs ask themselves one question: "Why doesn't NRM assassinate its opponents? Is it because we do not have the guns or the capacity?" 

"Why did we oppose the assassination of Oyite Ojok in the Nile Mansions in 1980-81?" The answer to this is the difference between freedom fighters and fascists and pigs. 

It says in the Book of Matthew 7:6: "Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine lest they trample them under their feet , and turn and tear you in pieces." 

It also says in the Book of Proverbs Chapter 2 verse 14: "Ziryabareeba ababikora, naabo ababishemererwa" - (Woe to those who find joy in doing evil and delight in the perversity of evil).

As we improve our technical capacity in the towns, the sub-committee of National Security, under the Chairmanship of CDF, yesterday decided to recommend to me the call-up of some reserves to deploy wherever criminals may manifest themselves. 

Remember, we have a reserve of 12 million men and women. Our reluctance to call-up more man-power is because of trying to avoid costs so that we invest in developments. 

In the State-of-the-Nation address, I pointed out the work done on the roads and electricity. We shall have to decelerate on some of those projects so that we up-grade the security infrastructure and also, for a limited period, call up more man-power. 

Therefore, the cowardly pigs that shot Abiriga at leisure without any equalizing fire being directed at them, will next time get a more balanced equation.

I must also comment on the slow response of the police in the Kawanda area. There are 14 police personnel at Kawanda Trading Centre operating in squads. If they were ready and on stand-by, they could have rushed and blocked the few exit points from that area for the criminals. That is something the police in the whole country need to study. Prepared squads should be ready to move in a minute to respond or to block the exits of these criminals. 

Hon. Abiriga was known to me as a very loyal NRM cadre. I did not know that He was such a good mobiliser. My visit to the area of Kirinyabigo and Kawanda - Kaayi yesterday, showed me how much the people loved him on account of interacting well with them and, especially, the children. 

Collective security is better than individualized security of single bodyguards, sitting in the same vehicle with the principal. The individualized body-guarding helps against the low capacity criminals like the ones of Masaka. 

However, for the organised criminals, armed with rifles, collective security with cameras, patrol cars, foot standing patrols and other technical solutions are the way forward.
 
As you can see in the cases of Kaweesi and Abiriga, sitting with bodyguards (even if they are many) in a single soft skin vehicle, of whatever type, without vigilance of observing whether you are being followed by suspicious people, is not a solution. The enemy can, by surprise attack all of you, without giving you a chance to respond. If we try to have follow cars etc, the cost may be prohibitive. That is why collective security, which is possible, is superior. 

Down with the pigs. Down with the parasites. Abiriga has joined the glorious list of our warriors who fell in the struggle: Martin Mwesiga, Mwesigwa Black, Valerian Rwaheeru, Kagina, Musisi and numerous others that contributed to the victory of the NRM and the people of Uganda.

10/06/2018, 22:53 - Eria Kamya: I will soon comment. I must have missed a lot here
11/06/2018, 00:59 - Eria Kamya: I regret wasting my time reading this whole thing. In fact Mr Afande, as you caution us with what we should post on social media, you should also bear in mind that we also accommodate this nonsense without any choice. 

M7 is a very smart guy (of course with his writers, if at all the whole piece is even reliably from him).  He writes such a long article to occupy our minds with his lies yet the truth is on the surface.

 I was waiting for any part in the article to see where he commented on the fact that Abiriga was looking for him for six months. I didn't see it anywhere. It is very clear and on record that Abiriga has always been blocked from meeting him. I was expecting a proactive president, who minds about those who loved the late, to talk about this. Someone has been looking for you, and has been blocked for six months. And he continues to say that those around M7 don't want me to see or talk to him. Furthermore, the same person gets shot to death. Even the dumbest know that this is the gist of the matter. But M7 has successively dodged it in this article unless he talks about it at the burial today. 

So according to my thinking, it's very unfortunate that the president seems to know the killers. When Kaweesi died, he told Kayihura to clean up the force. How did he know that it was the police to clean up? Because up to now investigations are still ongoing but the guy knew which section needed cleaning up instantly. 

This time, it's the state house to clean because Abiriga looked sober and not a nagging drunkard who deserved to be kept away from seeing or even talking to the president. Now Abiriga is dead and he's tossing us around because he knows it's the people around him, of course his government, and could even be in the state house. Because who else would stop Abiriga from seeing or talking to the president if they weren't state house presidential aides? 

So too much love for power has caused a lot of political compromises that even some people are untouchable. 

Otherwise 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
11/06/2018, 04:24 - +60 16-475 8556: I think he doged it for security purposes not to allert the enemies around him...dats what you have to do not to allert the enemy that you realised he's within....
11/06/2018, 04:32 - +60 16-475 8556: But me I know one thing that money is gona be eaten still.....ever since mwami  Mbabazi left NRM things changed....they are just miendering.. here and there. He was a good implementer planner and good at public relations....first use the money for its purpose then eat or steal the balance...but these ppl they first steal then use the balance....and put their counterparts in positions strategically targeting money....I don't know which kind of satan is in money....
11/06/2018, 04:34 - +60 16-475 8556: And the article is suiting the situation wait after six months....
11/06/2018, 07:00 - Eria Kamya: Dodging it for security reasons creates room for more compromises. A mere statement in that direction can change things a lot. Even if it's not implemented, but the thieves get shaken and sanity can be restored in them. If they can arrest hundreds of innocent people whenever such assassinations occur, it means they don't investigate first but rather arrest and investigation follows. Why do you think In such cases they're willing to be responsive? Because it deals with distant innocent people. But this case could be attached to nearby people. And many of them have been compromised already.
11/06/2018, 07:23 - Eria Kamya: The president also said something about cameras. He said that it's not easy to by such things from outside and that's why their installation has delayed. Maybe those who did procurement courses can confirm this. But what I think it's more of priorities and less about procedures. But what I know about government is they can do such procurements as quickly as possible. When mps asked for new vehicles, each around 200 million, I don't think the same procedural difficulties would be faced. Actually I don't remember whether they were bought or not. Someone can clarify on this. 

One time Gashumba said that he had a friend who was willing to provide Uganda with a camera that floats in the air in a balloon-like structure. So Gashumba contacted Kayihura and told him about it. The guy flew into Uganda to do a free test for six months. When Kayihura was contacted again, he could not be reached again. 🤷‍♂ I think you all know why he couldn't be reached again.
11/06/2018, 07:26 - +256 701 406572: Thanks bro Kamya for your views. The only correction I wanted to make is that it's one of Admins who cautioned us on what to post NOT me. As per my work, I belong to  many social groups and they are posting a lot of disturbing and distorted news. It's modern trend and power of social media. But I believe in freedom of speech and it's only way I learn what others think so that we improve our country if it's constructive criticism. I believe anything put here minus personal attacks is beneficial one way. Of course I only fear people in a group who keep silent coz that is most dangerous to know the hidden motives. But as the President said, we can win our enemies  and allies through dialogue and debate of ideas. It's why Africa is behind - suppressing voices. We are learning lessons from these killings and soon they will be history if measures are put in place. As the president said, evil will never triumph over good. Musisi had good plans to clean the city and regulate Boda Bodas but she was not supported. Now, everyone is seeing the benefits of her good brains. Be blessed members in Malaysia and remain hopeful for our beloved nation to come out of this.
11/06/2018, 07:38 - +60 11-3637 6788: Thank u for accommodating every view.
11/06/2018, 07:45 - Eria Kamya: Thank you and sorry for falsely pinning you. My worry is that the only thing the country has benefited from the investigations are further killings. It then becomes a chain. Because whenever truth is about to come out, someone dies. That's why I am calling it a chain that has no sign of ending. If you can trace back from the moslem cases, to Kagezi, Kaweesi, Kiggundu and now Abiriga, the reason why we don't get reports easily is because people are killed towards the peak of the investigations. This means that the country needs more proactivity as the one used by the assassins and their bosses. They have outcompeted us. They're both smart and proactive. Meanwhile we're busy investigating. Kirumira said the the whole police from top to the middle is rotten. IGP was changed and so far no change.
11/06/2018, 07:48 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: RIP Abiriga. I had never seen any loyal person in Ugandan politics like abiriga. This man always spoke out his whole heart even though he supported NRM. He is an example of loyalty and honesty. Pray for our Uganda cause if abiriga can be shot what of me a common man who moves midnight plus hours
11/06/2018, 07:50 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Let this group strictly be of the concerns about the alumni and embassy. I kindly ask you Eria to open up a group of Politics and send the link here whoever wants to join will join. A blessed week to you all

11/06/2018, 08:24 - Eria Kamya: If you think keeping quiet will spare you from your fate, then 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂. I know exactly what these posts can amount to. And I have also learnt that guns and body guards also don't help. I have further learnt that being an innocent Ugandan will also not help because many have innocently died (Nansana and Entebbe ladies, abductees, etc). Even being in the government will still not help. *It is therefore God that can help*. Abiriga surrendered to NRA during the 1980s and it has not helped. I have also learnt that death is real because I am a complete orphan. But this has proved to me about the ability of God because I am not in Malaysia on any scholarship, but a private arrangement. 

This has actually taught me the meaning of life. Once you have known what life means, and the actual meaning of life, then death will not scare you. I always seek to know more about other people, races and beliefs.  It has taught me a lot. I am therefore not even scared about government because I know the people who are always targeted. 

Bear in mind that many soldiers were able to escape death during the wars but have died in simpler ways. I won't mention all of them but you know them. This should therefore remind you that death is natural, it occurs to anyone and in any way. 

There's no way I can be scared of death in the way you think when many other means are in place. I always ask my friends who are so careful about their diets, that how certain are you about the cause of your death? 

So my brother if you think you can avoid death, then you're crossing a two-way Road without looking at both sides.

11/06/2018, 08:52 - Eria Kamya: So please Michael, the next time you scare me with your cowardly posts, please be reminded of the following:
- The people who died in the LRA war didn't have any political motives. 

-The people who died in Kasese also had no political motives. 

-The victims of the 2010 world cup bombings didn't have any political motives. 

-The Kibwetere victims also didn't have any political motives. 

-Etc... 

All these are political issues but ended up claiming innocent lives. This is a mere grain about how death is a multiway thing. I just pointed out these because they were closely political-minded, and that they claimed many lives each.

Diaspora community from time of independence  (Kenyatta, Kwame, Museveni in Dar Salaam, etc) have played crucial role in shaping the destiny of many nations. Now with power of social media, we can benefit a lot from Alumni Abroad especially  to push prosperity of our nation. Ofcourse transforming  classroom theories to reality on ground in Uganda environment is not easy but God will always support good over evil. Uganda was highlighted by IMF to be the second fastest growing nation in terms of GDP after India by 2025. We need bright ideas for this to occur and my only request for Admins is to guide and direct discussions with respect to our leaders (who come from God) and other members.

ABIRIGA DIED CHASING HIS MILLIONS
-------------------------------------------------------
FROM NOW, FELLOW UGANDANS, STOP LOOKING FURTHER FOR  THE KILLERS OF IBRAHIM ABIRIGA.I HAVE JUST BEEN BRIEFED AND SHOWN INTEL POINTING AT THE KILLERS OF ABIRIGA. THE LATE ABIRIGA HAD BEEN TRACING A SO CALLED PACKAGE FROM STATE HOUSE, MONEY THAT WAS AGREED TO BE PAID TO HIM FOR ABANDONING REBEL ACTIVITY AND SETTLING DOWN. LAST YEAR  IN MARCH, THIS MONEY WHICH WAS SLIGHTLY OVER ONE BILLION, WAS APPROVED BY M7, AND THAT IS WHEN THE PLOT TO FINISH OFF ABIRIGA WAS HATCHED BY M7'S PRINCIPAL PRIVATE SECRETARY IN COLLUSION WITH A STATE MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE. THE DUO WENT AHEAD AND AND SIGNED FOR THE MONEY WHICH THEY STOLE, AND ABIRIGA WAS NOT EVEN AWARE THAT THE MONEY WAS PAID, FOR THE PPS WAS SUPPOSED TO CALL HIM AND ASK HIM TO PICK THE MONEY, SOMETHING SHE DID NOT DO. LATER ABIRIGA  GOT INFORMATION FROM MOSES ALI THAT HIS MONEY HAD BEEN RELEASED, WHICH THREW ABIRIGA INTO A SHOCK SINCE HE HAD NOT RECEIVED EVEN A COIN  OR INFORMATION ABOUT IT. FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR, ABIRIGA TRIED TO ACCESS HIS BOSS MUSEVENI TO REPORT HOW HE HAD NOT GOT THE MONEY , BUT THE PPS HAD INSTRUCTED THE ENTIRE STATE HOUSE STAFF, NEVER TO ALLOW ABIRIGA NEAR STATE HOUSE OFFICES. ABIRIGA SOON GAVE UP ON THE MONEY, UNTIL RECENTLY WHEN ONE MINISTER FROM NORTHERN  UGANDA MANAGED TO ARRANGE A MEETING FOR ABIRIGA WITH M7, WHICH WAS SCHEDULED FOR THIS WEEK JUNE 13TH. THE PPS CAME TO KNOW ABOUT IT AND HE AND THE SAID MINISTER WHOM THAY HAD HAD STOLEN THE MONEY TOGETHER  AND ARE EVEN RELATIVES, PLANNED THE MURDER OF ABIRIGA USING SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND SOLDIERS. AFTER DAYS OF SURVAILLING HIS HOME, AND MOVEMENTS, ABIRIGA WAS PUT DOWN IN A HAIL OF BULLETS..

 ANY OTHER VERSION OF ABIRIGA'S DEATH SHOULD BE DISMISSED WITH ALL THE CONTEMPT. THIS INFORMATION IS UNCONTESTABLE. THERE IS MORE LEFT OUT TO PROTECT SOURCES. MAY HIS SOUL REST IN PEACE.
12/06/2018, 05:56 - +60 11-2895 6258: Is this true??
12/06/2018, 06:23 - +60 16-475 8556: Kavudde bulaya kati kiri eri gwe okusalawo...munange...
12/06/2018, 06:39 - +60 16-475 8556: Naye nze ndaba abayekera oba terrorists tubawayiriza abo ba guy baba basoma man they know who where and when to target naye kati Abiriga no nze still mbusabusa nga bwekyaali ku Afande Kaweesi neku Hon.Abiriga bwekibadde...dats mi thinking....
12/06/2018, 08:04 - Eria Kamya: It sounds true. Like I stated earlier, the moment someone says that I have been looking for the president but the people around him don't want me to either see or talk to him, it absolutely means that these people are certainly answerable especially when the same person is further assassinated. And Abiriga was a sober person. Even six months of looking for the president is a long period. So there must be a planned blockage, which can only be successfully done by state house guys. These same reasons have always caused delays in government projects.
12/06/2018, 09:20 - +256 701 406572: Complete nonsense, falsifying information and causing unnecessary frictions. We should wait for investigations. But the author can also report to Police to help investigation not social media. The author having known Abiriga wanted to meet HE, tried to  cook reasons and connect the State House employees with aim to tarnish their image. Former UNRF rebels were well compasanted in batches as group long ago after signing peace agreement and have been serving in UPDF. There was no individual negotiated surrender but whole group laid down arms and terms of agreement fulfilled. As I said earlier, anything you do in hiding and can't defend it in light publically is evil and will be defeated. The author might just text from his dream bed in UK or USA to confuse some ignorant souls.
12/06/2018, 09:27 - +60 11-2803 7720: Afande, well, there are a lot of inaccuracies in the post but such posts come up if the state looses the credibility to broadly investigate. 

Had there been a competent and thorough investigation into past murders and prosecution done, people would have put all their confidence in the Police and other state organs to investigate.

But now, I am sure deep down your heart as part of a big state organ, you know, there won’t be thorough investigations into this murder, the culprits won’t be brought in and nothing is going to happen after the waves calm. 

This is what triggers the public to investigate and come out with their reports. Which BTW may have substance in one way or the other.
12/06/2018, 09:37 - +256 701 406572: Very true bro Daaki but as Minister Jeje said yesterday, security forces stop at just producing evidence and courts of law take charge. There are many lessons learnt in past and they promised us that the future will be improved and okay. I agree with you the reasons public sometimes comes up with their own investigations on social media but this strengthens the killers who are now celebrating when they see such posts.
12/06/2018, 10:02 - +60 16-475 8556: Sikumanyi Afande but the truth is even if I were you...dats what I wud have said...trust me you can no longer defend this government diplomatically especially with all the lies your and my govt have been putting across....me what I hate is to test mi credibility testing mi intelligence really...now most of us are educated and we know what is going on in our country and we have witnessed...now bse of social media no one has monopoly over technology.news and skills....

12/06/2018, 13:14 - Eria Kamya: I was watching the video when M7 visited Abiriga's home. He told the highest police officer at the scene to always update the public about  investigations. For example, He told him that they should always tell the public about the numbers, who has been arrested, and who is still missing. But yesterday, these security chiefs trampled this saying they don't need to update the public. 

Another guy shamelessly denied that he has never heard of any torture by the police towards the suspects. He further denied existence of any safe houses and torture rooms. But then Watasa wants this forum to relax with these answers from the security guys?
12/06/2018, 13:55 - +60 16-475 8556: They don't accept that things have changed from analog to digital....bakyabalira mu biri ebyedda....its one of the challenges they have....and  so contradictory...
12/06/2018, 16:34 - +60 16-226 6917: I hope members are not exiting this group because of politics. 🤔
12/06/2018, 16:35 - Eria Kamya: Hahaha
12/06/2018, 16:38 - Eria Kamya: I think we should start talking about world cup now to reduce the politicalphobia in the group 🤣🤣🤣🤷🏻‍♂
12/06/2018, 16:45 - +60 16-226 6917: Mobilising Ugandans here in Malaysia is an uphill task. Tuleme kuzimbulula ('Un-build') what we have built guys.

12/06/2018, 17:52 - +256 755 911999: Politics is apart of our lives....our lives in totality are affected by it. We should not look the other way because this is our home. N we should be mature enough to agree to disagree... To each his own opinion however we should be able to find a middle ground. That said....am looking forward to invites for the big day ahead plus world cup ofcos..😊
12/06/2018, 17:53 - +44 7914 583339: Oh am free from friday until monday. all invites are welcome
12/06/2018, 20:39 - +256 701 406572: Egyptian Saha recovering well to carry Egypt and African hopes. We pray Nigeria also push to Semis this time coz have talented squad
12/06/2018, 20:41 - Eria Kamya: Any predictions for the teams that will make it to the semi finals?

12/06/2018, 20:44 - Eria Kamya: You're ruling out Argentina, England Belgium and Portugal. Why??
12/06/2018, 20:46 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Argentina has Great players but very disorganised. England has average players. Portugal it won’t go anywhere even when I supper CR7 Belgium has a lot of chances to reach semifinals as well
12/06/2018, 20:46 - +44 7914 583339: Why are u even considering England. 😂
12/06/2018, 20:46 - +44 7914 583339: who are u?
12/06/2018, 20:47 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: But World Cup is so amazing any team can win the title
12/06/2018, 20:47 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣
12/06/2018, 20:47 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Belgium has performed very well during qualifiers and friendlies
12/06/2018, 20:48 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Germany hasn’t performed well in friendliest but when it’s the tournament they can really perform well
12/06/2018, 20:48 - Eria Kamya: No one likes England when it comes to world cup oba why 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤷🏻‍♂
12/06/2018, 20:48 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: But to me aaa person I see Brazil winning the title this time round. These idiots have good players and they kinda too organised
12/06/2018, 20:49 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Not liking the team is just shit
12/06/2018, 20:49 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Even when the entire squad plays premier league
12/06/2018, 20:49 - +44 7914 583339: To be honest England has mediocre players.
12/06/2018, 20:50 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Talk about it bro
12/06/2018, 20:50 - Eria Kamya: England is always spoilt by their own media
12/06/2018, 20:50 - +44 7914 583339: u mean to say overrated.
12/06/2018, 20:50 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Hehehehehehehe
12/06/2018, 20:51 - Eria Kamya: Exactly
12/06/2018, 20:51 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: That’s what his trying to mean
12/06/2018, 20:51 - +44 7914 583339: How do u call Henderson one of the top 5 midfielders in the world cup. like 😳
12/06/2018, 20:51 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Like seriously he can never been be among top 10 not even top 20
12/06/2018, 20:52 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Forgive me for typing errors
12/06/2018, 20:53 - Eria Kamya: That's why most German and Brazilian players are always bound to follow what their legends advice them to do. But when it comes to England 😅
12/06/2018, 20:54 - +256 701 406572: And you rule out our own Nigeria Super Eagles. When will we believe in our own?
12/06/2018, 20:55 - +44 7914 583339: Am team brazil. they have good women too. 🤔

12/06/2018, 20:57 - Eria Kamya: Indisputable
12/06/2018, 21:12 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Well I believe in Nigeria as well but they trying to copy and play like whites which is very dangerous. African football isn’t played like that so I don’t think they can go further. The way they played against England on the last friendly I was so sad
12/06/2018, 21:12 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Am team Brazil too
12/06/2018, 21:25 - Eria Kamya: This is being conservative. Don't you admire the style of play of the 2008 Egyptian team? But still they're Africans.
12/06/2018, 21:26 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Well those Egyptians who even don’t claim themselves Africans most of me
12/06/2018, 21:26 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: I rather support Nigeria than Egypt
12/06/2018, 21:26 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 don't be racist ate
12/06/2018, 21:27 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Why would I be
12/06/2018, 21:27 - Eria Kamya: As if you're a victim
12/06/2018, 21:27 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: U try to ask those Egyptians if they Africans they will rather call themselves whites
12/06/2018, 21:27 - Eria Kamya: You may share your experiences
12/06/2018, 21:27 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Do u even have friends from Egypt
12/06/2018, 21:27 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
12/06/2018, 21:27 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Victim of what
12/06/2018, 21:28 - Eria Kamya: Of racism
12/06/2018, 21:28 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Why would I be
12/06/2018, 21:29 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Yet am one of the person who even interacts with Somali and Djibouti guys on the filed while many don’t want to play with them due to chaos. So can any racist person do that unless u mad
12/06/2018, 21:29 - Eria Kamya: Then why are you bothered by Egyptians calling themselves whites
12/06/2018, 21:30 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Because they aren’t and they will never be
12/06/2018, 21:30 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Even by history they aren’t whites
12/06/2018, 21:31 - Eria Kamya: Of course

That is confidential information which he is not allowed to relay to the public. 
Thank you.
12/06/2018, 22:35 - +60 11-2803 7720: Sikyamuse, but the manner in which the story is reported, the time and the circumstances in the country call for speculation.

13/06/2018, 07:13 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Good u know he was loyal. It doesn’t matter which party your were loyal but he spoke out with his heart.
13/06/2018, 07:13 - +60 17-364 3269: His trying to say , abiriga was innocent . N that nrm betrayed him . Wc is half true bse he took money from em .
13/06/2018, 07:14 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: It’s more than true cause they betrayed him. This man wanted to meet the president since March but mafias refused him
13/06/2018, 07:14 - +60 17-364 3269: Loyalty with pay is not real loyalty .
13/06/2018, 07:14 - Eria Kamya: Which money??
13/06/2018, 07:14 - +60 17-364 3269: Mafias can’t refuse him , unless the mafias are the president
13/06/2018, 07:15 - +60 17-364 3269: They took money for supporting the age limit bill
13/06/2018, 07:15 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Talking about age limit money of which every MP got
13/06/2018, 07:15 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Stop assuming what u don’t know every MP was given 24millions for consulting
13/06/2018, 07:15 - Eria Kamya: Then if the money was given to all nrm mps then why him?
13/06/2018, 07:16 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Those who didn’t want it like bobi wine took back the money
13/06/2018, 07:16 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes , they were all given money as mps , n some members of the opposition took it back
13/06/2018, 07:17 - Eria Kamya: Then why was he haunted when other mps still took the money
13/06/2018, 07:17 - +256 782 688599: Kato lubwama had proper accountability for it.
13/06/2018, 07:18 - +60 17-364 3269: Oh please , people in the north don’t need 24 m
13/06/2018, 07:18 - +60 17-364 3269: To tell people to vote right
13/06/2018, 07:18 - +60 17-364 3269: That lady n and abiriga did not consult people , they simply told them to accept the age limit bill
13/06/2018, 07:19 - +60 17-364 3269: They didn’t explain to them the pros n cons of doing so , they simply told em. To accept it .
13/06/2018, 07:19 - +256 782 688599: Anite
13/06/2018, 07:19 - +60 17-364 3269: They did not use the money for consulting .
13/06/2018, 07:19 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes Anite
13/06/2018, 07:20 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Do u have any evidence that he didn’t go there oooooooh please
13/06/2018, 07:21 - Eria Kamya: So how does this connect to him being killed?
13/06/2018, 07:21 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: U just said hey didn’t consult people and now u saying they told them to accept. Why contradict yourself
13/06/2018, 07:21 - +60 17-364 3269: He went there , but didn’t consult , he simply told people to accept it .
13/06/2018, 07:22 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Gwe nkuvudeko
13/06/2018, 07:22 - Eria Kamya: So how does it amount to his assassination
13/06/2018, 07:22 - +60 17-364 3269: I think u should understand English , there is a difference btn consulting someone , and telling someone to accept something , one involves choice one does not

13/06/2018, 07:24 - +60 17-364 3269: I did not say this is the reason why he was killed . But no one targets u for no reason . If he was killed by mafias , it could be bse he didn’t not represent them well , it is a possibility .
13/06/2018, 07:24 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: So u trying to mean the airtel north group is so dump to just accept huh???
13/06/2018, 07:24 - +60 17-364 3269: If the mafias r not the government
13/06/2018, 07:24 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Why think all mafias A in government
13/06/2018, 07:25 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Well mafias a both in government and opposition
13/06/2018, 07:25 - Eria Kamya: So according to you, it might be a age limit cause for his death?
13/06/2018, 07:25 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Even in banks there mafias remember crane bank scenario
13/06/2018, 07:25 - +60 17-364 3269: So u think the airtel north group makes up the north

13/06/2018, 07:27 - +60 17-364 3269: North has high levels of illiteracy . I don’t know wetha u watched how abiriga n anite conducted those , so called consultations , they never explained to people the pros n cons , of doing so , like other mps did . They simply told there people that that’s wat is best for em , n they should accept it , if course not all agreed , but he supported it anyway .
13/06/2018, 07:29 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Let me tell u even if all opposition members voted no to age limit NRM would still win cause they a majority in the parliament there some things just not for me to even waste my time on
13/06/2018, 07:29 - Eria Kamya: @60173643269, could this justify the violence that broke out in his Arua home??
13/06/2018, 07:30 - +60 17-364 3269: Ofcourse , that’s true . No one said it was not

13/06/2018, 13:33 - Eria Kamya: Saying that alone shows that he's under arrest. I have not heard any security public relations officer denying it, which they always do instantly. But they're all quiet now. Should we assume the social media news that he's been arrested haven't reached any of them? 🤔🤔
13/06/2018, 13:35 - +60 16-475 8556: He knows it may happen anytime
13/06/2018, 13:35 - +60 16-475 8556: Maybe

13/06/2018, 15:51 - +60 11-2803 7720: He is a 🌟🌟🌟🌟General my friend. 
Not just any other officer 🤣🤣🤣
13/06/2018, 15:52 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: But he has been a updf solider and not a policeman even when he was IGP he was a updf solider
13/06/2018, 15:52 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Talk about it
13/06/2018, 16:00 - Eria Kamya: If you observe this letter very well, you see that he was asked to report to the CDF at mbuya. 🤔 Then subsequently, a chopper was sent to pick him🤔🤔 Then the chopper probably didn't find him meaning he was a supposed to report to the CDF but without prior notice 🤔🤔🤔🤔 

Now my fellow theorists, it's high time we used our heads like how Muntu told us. Why would a serving officer be required to appear before the serving CDF without prior notice to the subject, to the extent of the chopper going back empty 🤔🤔🤔 Was it a surprise report to the CDF??
13/06/2018, 16:02 - +60 11-2803 7720: According to Conspiracy Theory, 
It might have been an abrupt meeting that demanded his expertise as s Legend in manning security 🤗🤗
But like I said, this is just another Theory
13/06/2018, 16:04 - Eria Kamya: Hahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Bro, as long as you're a serving officer, you're subject to orders!! If he wasn't in lyantonde at the moment, where else would he be that the chopper couldn't reach especially if it was an urgent matter?

A serving officer is asked to report to the CDF, which officer is expected to be knowing that he's required to meet the CDF.  The chopper reaches lyantonde and instead of proceeding to mbarara to pick him from there, it goes back to Kampala only to go back to lyantonde the next day. 

Then I don't understand the luxury here. Both in the CDF's orders and the tax payer's money. Brig Karemire should wait for the next reshuffle 🤣🤣🤣

14/06/2018, 08:24 - Eria Kamya: But why would they ashame Kayihura to that extent. Wouldn't they arrest him in a more diplomatic way, given he's still a serving officer as Karemire claims ?  🤔🤔🤔
14/06/2018, 08:26 - +256 782 688599: When he planned for kaweesi murder, he didn't do it in a diplomatic manner.So he deserves it

14/06/2018, 08:38 - Eria Kamya: Giving him an exile after conviction?? That would have been made earlier. Unless they are planning to show Ugandans who was behind the killing, and in some way grant him bail, then he flees away into exile but after revealing the killer to the public
14/06/2018, 08:40 - Eria Kamya: Kano sikategedde

14/06/2018, 12:58 - +60 11-2895 6258: Hihi
14/06/2018, 12:59 - Eria Kamya: You remember what they did at Abiriga's burial 🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂ they overpowered the police

 Yoweri Kaguta Museveni
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
15/06/2018, 17:17 - +60 10-767 0113: Thanks a lot our H.E Dorothy Samali Hyuha.
16/06/2018, 04:19 - Eria Kamya: <Media omitted>
16/06/2018, 04:38 - +60 12-380 9334: http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/oped/comment/Uganda-small-minded-Kenya-and-Rwanda-think-big/434750-4610144-5o9h6b/index.html
16/06/2018, 04:38 - +60 12-380 9334: Eid mubarak comrades
16/06/2018, 05:14 - +60 11-2895 6258: People you better be careful with the words you use on social media
16/06/2018, 06:00 - +60 16-226 6917: Thank you @60123809334. But to be honest, the moment I saw the headline, I knew that the article had been written by a Ugandan.😏
16/06/2018, 06:53 - +60 11-2895 6258: True
16/06/2018, 08:00 - +60 11-2895 6258: https://youtu.be/CS2pdRRzgzE
16/06/2018, 08:44 - +256 755 911999: This is so true. Read somewhere that Mzee is threatening media houses on reporting Uganda's economy as a failing one just because it hasn't reached the threshold of 50% where debt is then referred to unmanageable...I felt sad our leader is surely old his ways of thinking are deteriorating. Countries are fighting to be debt free, to be able to fund their budgets and ours is smiling because our debt is at 31.6% therefore not yet above the threshold. His tag line is hydro electricity which is to bring in more investors... but with the current price of the dollar and how it continues to increase i dont know that people will want to invest and even if they do the looming insecurity is not an issue to be ignored. kwegamba there's still so much to do.
16/06/2018, 09:25 - Eria Kamya: In fact, while Rwanda was launching the visit Rwanda partnership campaign with Arsenal,  we were busy mourning 11 lions that were killed. 

 When this guy says we think small, He actually means it. A small country without the abundance of wildlife thought big and out of the box to boost their tourism in a different way. 

In the same period when the UN airbase was speculatively to be relocated, a newly purchased police chopper, yet to be launched, failed to fly on its maiden flight in Uganda!! Yes it failed to leave the ground, leaving the whole function and officers testifying to the curse that befell the pearl of Africa.

Meanwhile me I wasn't taken by surprise because I knew that having failed the whole Uganda Airlines, purchasing mechanically poor chopper wasn't a big issue for these officials.
16/06/2018, 09:32 - +256 755 911999: As for the chopper that cost oba how much n barely got off the ground....hmmm. then those Lions wildlife authority is useless just. How do u bite the hand that feeds you
16/06/2018, 09:39 - Eria Kamya: In fact that the chopper reminded me of another chopper that crushed into a roof of a house. I think similar poor mechanical conditions caused the crash. Fallen AIGP Kaweesi was still alive and had just visited the victims to assure them about the police reconstructing their home. However him having died shortly later, I hope they did so.

17/06/2018, 08:25 - +60 12-380 9334: Getting Poorer. 
Today, I passed by at City oil, there is a simple mini supermarket, I just needed to buy tissue. I found 2 smartly dressed and beautiful Somali girls on the entrance of the supermarket. They all welcomed me with a smile and greeted me with humor. " You are most welcome sir, plz come in and make ur choice. " One said to me. 
They all escorted me to the shelves and picked what I wanted. 

On my way out,  it had started raining, one girl out of customer care picked an umbrella, which I never even expected, covered me up-to the parking yard as she kept convincing me to keep buying from their shop. 
You could see this beautiful, determined girl willing to do business and retain this potential  customer much as I had only spent 5000/ in their shop. I just thanked her and went away. 

But THAT'S NOT MY POINT. 
on my way home, I found this Ugandan woman selling Matooke, I stopped by and wanted to buy one for my family. 
Asked, "Madam amatooke gameeka? "
While she was looking the other posite side, she even didn't turn to look at me, she just replied, "emitwaalo ebiiri"
I said, madam oba kankuwe omutwaalo!
She turned as if I had abused her and told me, " olobooza amatooke ngaajja mulusuku lwa Jaajja woo? "
I just went away and looked for it somewhere else, and also there the story wasnt so different, the attention was the same maybe to her, she was abit polite. 
But I finally bought at 20k and carried them myself into the vehicle. 
But still thats not my point.
 
My point is, the ones I supported with 5k, took me as a king and I meant heaven to them while the ones I did with 20k, took me as a no one and I meant nothing to them.
 
This is just one example in Uganda representing millions of worst senerios. 
This is how poor Ugandans run poorer. They start small businesses and fail and all they consider taking is more litres of anointing oil and blessed water from their pastors. While they chase away Money every single day. 

These foreigners come with nothing and become our bosses our our so called graduates. 

You will not hear many testimonies of Ugandans who started something and sustained to an international level. 
All we do, is to believe that the brown are superior, even somalies!!!? 
I swear, u enter into an Indian shop, and an Indian gives u his chair and sit like a king while u bargain, whereas u enter in a Ugandan shop, u meet a woman painting her lips as she is covered with multicolored manufactured hair, and see her looking with one eye under the hair and asks u without any kind of care, What do u want? 
We keep losing to the west.

 Ugandans are dieing in poverty, while we have the largest portion of resources. 
Millions go to school and study but still such characters they learned from their parents hinder their development. 
There's isnt any indian graduate who anticipate poverty or riches from government. They know what to do from childhood. 
Where as here, it's fighting, quarreling, romours, and hatred. 

Our youth are busy on social media, and bse of such backgrounds, to them everything is wrong, they abuse everyone instead of looking for business partners or get contacts of those who are well placed. 
We have no discipline, you order for a car from Japan and it comes the way u ordered and nothing changes not even the spareparts, but order for Irish and see here. 
It's bse of all this, u see people born, grow, get used and die in poverty and the trend doesn't seem to be changing soon.

17/06/2018, 09:04 - Eria Kamya: Thank you Dr Siraje for this. 

But for the time you have been in Malaysia, you should be knowing what foreign policy means. If you can remember very well, it was one of the key things discussed in the presidential debate. 

I have only been in Malaysia for six months, but I know how this country deals with this policy. Of course, this adds to what I have heard from those in other countries. But my country doesn't even have a clear foreign policy. That's why we see these foreign investors enjoying tax holidays, only to realise later that the companies are owned by the president or his relatives. But still, when these foreigners are put in charge of these companies they're left to come with all workers as they wish. Just leaving a few positions for Ugandans and mainly for manual workers.

It's only leaders who like their people to be well that mind about the foreign policy. Ugandans are not as bad as you think. Imagine that lady who was selling the matooke. Probably she's a mother of many school going kids with a careless father. And probably she's tired of explaining to Ugandans (like the one who was asking for the price) that she's not the one who is causing the high price for the matooke. In fact, many of such guys push these poor ladies to the wall by negotiating strongly until the lady can only get 500/=as profit from the whole matooke bunch. The same guys don't even negotiate when they come to Indian shops and supermarkets. They simply buy because they've seen beautiful girls in the supermarket.

 These same guys are even supposed to know who is responsible for the high prices but when they meet these poor ladies, they exercise their bargaining skills. 

You should also know that those girls are paid for what they're doing. I thought that you would blame the authorities who allowed these girls into the country only to welcome customers. My dear, we also have beautiful girls in Uganda who can do this. But if the government allows both the technical as well as the non technical foreigners, you'll see Uganda doing what South Africans did to their foreigners.

If the president can get upset just with the murder of Abiriga to come up constitutionally conflicting directives, then imagine a poor lady who even faces high taxes on paraffin.

17/06/2018, 10:32 - Eria Kamya: My brother you will continue talking about customer care... The day you'll go to mulago and doctors show no care to your patient, is the day you'll realise that personal problems especially those caused by the government can cause your patients to die.
17/06/2018, 10:33 - +60 11-3637 6788: I don't find this contestable although there are growing  societal challenges. We can do well once our people understand the values and relationship between a merchant and the customer.
This can be achieved through many ways such as good education policies, good governance policies, clear  regulations, marketing skills and better understanding of market environment. Unfortunately to a considerable extent they are missing.

17/06/2018, 10:41 - +256 755 911999: I am a girl. My name is Marklyn. We blame the government for everything. As a doctor you take an oath to save lives first so by neglecting this oath because of personal problems or government created problems says alot about your character as a person. Know that there will never be a perfect situation... N that's y it's better for people to work from a place of purpose and passion and not possible paycheck. I know doctors who happily treat people on credit because their oath to save a life means everything to them...then I know others who can't touch a dying person because they've not made a deposit of one million. But that's mostly because they went back into the profession for the money and the prestige. Same thing with some lawyers and business people. They get into these professions for the money. Your purpose should mean more to you than any amount of money because at the end of the day you can loose all the money you worked for but you can never loose the feeling of satisfaction in self for doing a tremendous job
17/06/2018, 10:48 - Eria Kamya: Thank you @256755911999. I am heartily sorry mistaking your gender. 

Don't forget the the government also pledges to provide good conditions to workers but then do the opposite
17/06/2018, 10:49 - +256 755 911999: People go to school and learn these things that should be obvious. If a guy is giving you money or is a potential for a good or service you ought to treat him like a king...that's just common sense...what government policies do u suggest??? If people don't want to work no matter how much the government favours them it will be useless same as regulations and all. Y should an outsider come and regulate your business??? It's your business for crying out loud you should want to see it succeed. You should put in the work. Let's not shift blame to make ourselves feel better. As for that mulago jazz been there list my best friend to that rubbish place... Instead of crying about what the government can do we should what can we do??? This group alone can make a difference
17/06/2018, 10:49 - +60 11-3637 6788: Thank you markyn. The oath taking does not mean you shouldn't have justifiable standards of living. It's a small self imprisonment. You will surely be correct to live by oath if you are paid due. A profession is not a charitable organization.

It’s fine, there may not be good customer relations in Mulago, but that isn’t representative of Uganda. 

Before we deduce, I’ll  just ask, has any one been to IHK in Namugongo, or Paragon Hospital, or Nakasero hospital or Kololo Hospital or mengo, Nsambya, Rubaga, Case or Kibuli Hospital? 
Because these are private hospitals, people are so hospitable and welcoming. They value customer relations and know that their jobs depend on it. 

Now, like all public entities, these people behave in an almost similar way. You’ll also find Mulago like behaviours when you visit Hospital Kuala Lumpur which is public but then, find IHK like reception when you visit a private hospital like Columbia Asia Hospital. 

The public service hospitality disease is everywhere my brother.
17/06/2018, 10:51 - +60 11-3637 6788: You may be firing in a wrong direction.
17/06/2018, 10:59 - Eria Kamya: Bro, any hospital that is so hospitable knows that you must pay for the hospitality. No hospital is mentioned above is cheap. In fact, they also know that they're dealing with rich government and Business people. Unless you're trying to say that the poor should be doomed with poor services and poor customer care, then I will agree with you. 

Being poor doesn't subject someone to the worst conditions. Otherwise we should all be rich without the poor. You should know that we live among the poor and that's life and reality. But they also deserve to be treated well. Don't expect the poor to go to these expensive private hospitals so as to taste the good hospitality. They'll of course go to the public hospitals. But they are always expected to get a fair treatment in these public hospitals.
17/06/2018, 11:02 - +60 11-2803 7720: In complement to this, we are forgetting the *Human Element*
Doctors in Mulago treat a vast number of people. Mulago is over crowded, with more unsick people than sick people. One patient has 4 people looking after them. 
Now imagine these people crowding over a doctor requesting them to see their patient and imagine someone from every patient coming every minute. 
If you are not rude, these people will keep coming. 
Now this might be the Genesis of the customer care problem, it’s not a government issue. It’s our personal issue. 

Mulago has got a business process from admitting patient to how doctors meet the patients and others but because *WE* Ugandans don’t take time to value this, we always look of a way place to by pass it. We always want to be served first no matter finding other people waiting. We don’t have any respect of cues, let alone business processes. 
My request is that before we blame these Doctors and Mulago people, we should look at the people they are dealing with and empathy, ask yourself, if it were you having the same situation, what would be your response?
17/06/2018, 11:10 - +60 11-2803 7720: You are insinuating that Mulago Hospital doesn’t treat people well, I beg to differ. 
There is no hospital in Uganda that treats as many patients at a time as Mulago. And usually doctors and other hospital staff at Mulago are not always rude at patients, they are rude at these people posing as caretakers for the patients. 

For several weeks, I was treated at Mulago hospital in the general ward of 1C. There wasn’t an instance when a doctor, a nurse or even cleaning staff were rude at me. They were so respectful of every other patient in the ward. 
I however have seen on many instances a doctor being rude at those taking care of the patients who come bumping into the doctor to treat their patients first. 

Now, find sometime and Visit Mulago. Spend a day or two, or three doing some reasearch about the hospital, you’ll even appreciate it more.

One time still in mulago, I I saw a man on bed (of course without a any sheets), and the man was totally naked. This man was over 30 years. Now who is responsible for making sure that at least the hospital has the basic materials like sheets atleast to cover people as their relatives come?? 

I never said that the doctors are bad because during that time when I was there, we're treated well. But the government doesn't do their part. Have ever heard these doctors striking due to large numbers of patients?? no!! But they strike because at times they can not do certain things simply because the government is carefree

17/06/2018, 11:37 - +60 11-2803 7720: We keep blaming the government for everything. And we never blame ourselves. 
Before they used to provide “green bedsheets”.

What happened? probably Ugandans stole them until a time when they decided not to provide anymore. 

If Ugandans can steal garbage bins off the streets, how about Hospital bedsheets. 

Part of the problem is not caused by the government. It’s caused by us. 

Not everything is solvable by the government my friend. 
Even when the government is changed, there won’t be any change until we as Ugandans do something called *Attitude Change*
17/06/2018, 11:39 - +60 11-2803 7720: Because you keep dragging government in almost every issue, sometimes it’s not about government, it’s about us *The PEOPLE*

17/06/2018, 11:50 - Eria Kamya: My brother @601128037720, if people stole the bedsheets then what do you expect me to do? Stealing is a criminal act which is handled by the government through the  inspector general of government. But nothing is done. And then you want me to blame the people??  If the bedsheets were stolen was there any action taken??  Medicine is always stolen and you want me to blame the people?? Have you ever heard of any investigation conducted to find out what is wrong and who steals the medicine?? And so we should blame the people??  These government officials simply smile at criminals until it reaches to them that they wake up. How many times was kayihura's terms renewed?
17/06/2018, 11:55 - +60 11-2803 7720: Of course I expect you to do NOTHING because the fact is, there is nothing you can do about it. 
See, it still come back to the poeple. If a public servant like a doctor steals medicine and you blame the government first? 
Blame the person who stole the medicine. The government did its part of sending the medicine but because WE the people have lost MORALS, we steal even from ourselves. People have become more greedy, selfish and self centred.

My brother, stop blaming government, find a way of making Uganda a morals based society. 

With morality, everything will change.
17/06/2018, 11:59 - Eria Kamya: I can not in anyway make Uganda a moral society when the former IGP himself admitted that *unless we address the people's social problems, changing the IGP has no impact on reducing crime.*
17/06/2018, 12:00 - +60 16-475 8556: Hmmm guys me I think a plant starts to die when the roots start rotting... if the heads in the family behave poorly before their kids...what do you expect from kids?..if yo parents or their policies are corrupt ...high chances of you becoming corrupt...ekitezaala tekyaala...
17/06/2018, 12:01 - Eria Kamya: 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
17/06/2018, 12:01 - +60 11-2803 7720: See, you are always Negative. If you want to address the people’s social problems, it starts with *Mindset change.*

There is nothing I am going to add on that.
17/06/2018, 12:02 - +60 16-475 8556: Govt has corrupted even churches and mosques which wud be healers every policy  run by the government affects us directly or indirectly nebwokola otya?
17/06/2018, 12:04 - +60 11-2803 7720: But then, we should look at the core. 
The roots of every government is We the people. That’s why they come for our Mandate every five years. 
Don’t ever think the leaders are the core of the country, *we the people* are the roots of our society. 
If we tap out, then we loose the society. These leaders come and go, but we the people never leave. 
We are the ROOTS.
17/06/2018, 12:06 - +60 16-475 8556: We only have a few individuals/doctors.Engineers.....who are morally good otherwise most pple are practicing what we term as natural selection...and for God and their families....its like our leaders are not Ugandans for sure....they are so political in every thing they do other than being practical
17/06/2018, 12:06 - Eria Kamya: You can not expect me to change people's mindsets when our freedom of speech is currently at stake by the same government. Today, people even fear to say anything.
17/06/2018, 12:08 - +60 16-475 8556: Ya ur right bt again even us are corrupted (rigging votes) meaning we are planted on rocks not the fertile soils
17/06/2018, 12:08 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
17/06/2018, 12:09 - +60 11-2803 7720: You may not change people’s mindset, you need to change yours. 
Brother, only positive minded people can pursue change. You don’t need to change the entire country, you can start with a friend or two. 
Being negative won’t yield us anything
17/06/2018, 12:11 - Eria Kamya: Bro I am not negative. I am always positive and objective. But in this case I am being realistic.
17/06/2018, 12:12 - +60 16-475 8556: Us we can manifest good change true but trust most of us will be influnced by the rest who are immoral coz we tend to loose  though we are good thats the challenge
17/06/2018, 12:14 - +60 11-2803 7720: Because we let it happen. We let the Vote rigging happen. They tried it in Jinja and Rukingiri by-elections and they failed. 

You see, I’ll tell you that Najib did everything possible to win, but he lost. 

What PH did was focus on Mindset change. They made the people look into the future. Beyond what Najib was showing them.

That’s why they won.
17/06/2018, 12:17 - +60 11-2803 7720: I may not decide what you are. That’s not for me.
But what I know, One of the characteristics of negative minded people is that they keep blaming someone for something.
17/06/2018, 12:18 - Eria Kamya: Bro Malaysia is not Uganda. How long did it take them to announce the final results??  Around six hours. In Uganda it takes us two days. That shows you the level of transparency. In Uganda, you have to sit back and wait for the final results which is not the case here. Anything you try to do you end up in jail. Even mere social media was cut off.
17/06/2018, 12:24 - +60 11-2803 7720: Mr. Eria, 
Announcing  the results with in 72 hours is within our law. So there is no law broken in that case. 
Let alone the resources and logistics issues Uganda’s EC faces, two days are adequate. 

Social media was cut off, true. But let us agree, many Ugandans are not ready to use social media. 
Just a week ago, you saw people making utterances during Kayihura’s arrest. There were reports claiming he had been shot and multiple false reports. 
You don’t see such unverified stuff in societies with high civility. 

If social media causes social tension, I may also limit its usage.
17/06/2018, 12:30 - Eria Kamya: Are you sure Kayihura wasn't shot??  At this moment no one knows. Ugandans are ready to use social media just that they always get excited celebrating arrest of criminals. This I don't blame them because some of them have tasted their criminal acts. 

Secondly, You're also about to say that not letting Ugandans to witness a transparent vote counting system in within our law. 

Thirdly, you're soon saying that delaying the voting materials up to around midday is also within our law. This one I witnessed myself.
17/06/2018, 12:37 - +256 755 911999: I agree with everyone who says it starts with us..As Ugandans we have let our own country down...our society is morally decayed. People in parliament don't come from heaven, they come from among us. They are a true depiction of the society we are. One that steals,hinders justice,oppresses others and hopes to gain where they have not sowed. I once left my computer cable in class by mistake and didn't notice till two days later, I remembered where I had left it and thought to check there... guess what I found it in the same place I had left it. Now in Uganda that is impossible not because we have a bad government but because we the people are thieves. Do you want to say to me that there no poor people  in Malaysia??? Noo but there is a degree of decency among the people. Yes there are thieves here too but that's normal every where vice is present but it should not be predominant
17/06/2018, 12:37 - +60 11-2803 7720: Mr. Kamya Eria, I don’t know what you mean by Ugandans not witnessing a transparent vote counting system.
I bring it to you, all Ugandans who wish to witness the vote counting. 

Vote counting takes place at the polling stations with representatives of all candidates around as well as the public who wish to. 
After which, a DR (declaration of results) form is signed by the returning officer and all representatives. 

That’s what our EC procedures provide for. What actually happens may be different because many people break the law. 
but I am certain, people get to witness the vote counting. 

As for logistical issues and delays in delivering voting materials, it happens in every country. Actually even in the most advanced of countries.
17/06/2018, 12:39 - +60 11-2803 7720: 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
17/06/2018, 12:43 - +60 16-226 6917: 🎉
17/06/2018, 12:44 - Samuel: 👌👌👌
17/06/2018, 12:49 - Eria Kamya: Maybe you were not in Uganda during the elections. Even media was banned from knowing what comes from the different polling stations nationwide. They were told to relax and wait for what the EC tells them. Because they wanted to verify results as they come in to the system which was denied. 

Who told you that a DR does it all?  For your information, everything is consolidated at the main centre. It is this centre that matters most. These DR form are not electronic. If they were electronic, then there would no issues at all. The final results on the DR forms are entered manually into the system. This is what the media wanted to verify so that they also keep track of the whole process.
17/06/2018, 12:54 - +60 11-2803 7720: Mr. Eria, Dont tell me you wanted the media to declare the president instead of the EC? 

It’s the mandate of the EC to brief the media, not the media to brief EC. Do not twist the things my brother. The media has to wait for the EC briefing to verify the results. 


But after what Marklyn has said, Allow me not to continue with any discussion but reflect on her post for the next 24 hours. 

It has a lot of substance.
17/06/2018, 12:59 - Eria Kamya: Everywhere, in every country there's theft and poverty. But these two things vary with countries. And they're also accelerated by our leaders. Remember by law, mob justice is not accepted. Therefore government assumes the whole responsibility through their security organs. Now this is where the problem starts from.
17/06/2018, 13:01 - Eria Kamya: I didn't say the media should have been left to declare the results. I was very clear and said that the media wanted to keep track of the whole process.
17/06/2018, 13:18 - +256 755 911999: I didn't say there countries without vice...I wonder what type of country that would be..... however that doesn't justify or take away the fact that for us it's beyond...Asin people steal street lights.... For wat now...these are things put in place to help us but alas a Ugandan takes... Olaba we still manhole covers then you ask yourself tulikuki
17/06/2018, 13:21 - Eria Kamya: Hahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣 you've reminded me of street lights which do not even last a month. Era ddala oba ffe tuli kuki 🤣🤣🤣
17/06/2018, 13:21 - +60 11-2803 7720: No muntu nno abba street lights tabeela mwangu. 
I ask myself, where are you going to use it?
17/06/2018, 13:21 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
17/06/2018, 13:22 - +256 755 911999: They take to catch grasshoppers
17/06/2018, 13:23 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣 but they even still faulty Street lights. Oba how do they fix them
17/06/2018, 13:25 - +256 755 911999: So do you see how it is not exactly the government's fault... Coz if they put n people keep stealing then??? At some point you just chill it's either that or break people's backs with random taxes to replace the things they've stolen...
17/06/2018, 13:29 - +60 11-2803 7720: The fact is, as a society, we are decayed. 
Many of us lack the basic morals. 
We don’t love our country. 

We throw garbage on the streets and blame government for a dirty city.

We don’t respect road signs, make accidents, we blame this on government. 

In some way, we have let our country down. Morals is something we should start teaching our people. Straight from our homes, workplaces and schools. 

Btw, Asian countries’ development has been attributed more on their culture and morals. May be we should copy something.
17/06/2018, 13:37 - Eria Kamya: But the issue is how and why do these people come to the extent of stealing Street lights??  You people think that Rwandese are well behaved? They have been shaped by the president who doesn't even spare his officials whenever they do something wrong. But here, you do something wrong in one ministry, you're sent to another.

 Rwanda was once a dirty country. But when an order was passed, it was followed by everyone because everybody knows that once you mess around, you're no exception.
17/06/2018, 13:39 - Eria Kamya: Mr@601128037720, the next time you are in Uganda, travel around the main highways. You'll realise that almost every new factory is in a wetland.
17/06/2018, 13:43 - +60 11-2803 7720: Mr Eria, travel around Malaysia, you’ll notice, there are several factories in wetlands. Forget this wetlands protection Hoax, with good mitigation strategies, we may not need wetlands if they don’t create jobs. 
Coca-Cola in Namanve was built on swamp reclaimed land, it pays taxes let alone employ more than 5000 people. 
Ask yourself, as a developing country, do we need the wetlands or we need the factories? 
Which strikes a better advantage?
17/06/2018, 13:47 - Eria Kamya: Okaay sir. If you want to know what strikes a better advantage, ask Chinese and you'll be answered.
17/06/2018, 14:02 - +60 16-475 8556: Naye musaaja ova Uganda kweeli hmmm omusajja yatutambuza mu kulonda in 2016 mu musana nga buli wotuuka mbu erinya lyo teriri wano paka era okitte naye paka lwetwalemerako naye nga negwetwagala okulonda kumbe basa kimu...yiiiii naye kirabika mzee tomutegeera  mukazanyo man ...mwana kite buti just manya twajirwa....

17/06/2018, 14:07 - +60 11-2803 7720: Hehe,
I started voting in 2006 then again in 2011. 
My name has always appeared on the voting register. 
You know, I blame all that on you. 
Prior to elections, the EC dedicates two weeks for Verification of your name on the register and after that period, there is another week for displaying the final voters’ register. 

You didn’t do that. And that’s why you didn’t know where your name was. 
And like I said, before we blame the government, did you do what is required of you?
17/06/2018, 14:14 - Eria Kamya: Bro you just said that everything is by mandate supposed to be done by the EC and now you're blaming @60164758556. Have you already forgotten what you said?? Assuming that the voter was away. Should they start worrying about whether their names appear on the voters list??  Then you accept that the EC is weak and they need our  intervention including the media 🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂
17/06/2018, 14:14 - +60 16-475 8556: Decay is from the top officials...naye banange ffena twagala awantu awali amateeka ....mzee amaze mu power 30yr+++and most pple stealing are from his group...mbu twateere embundu kati what of ba kadeyideyi osubira ki....banange sigaanye naye nze nkyanenya.govt...ok lwaaki amateeka tegakola?

17/06/2018, 14:17 - +60 11-2803 7720: No, EC does what’s required of them. 
Btw, they also puclished their names online and they provided an online website. 

If you are lazy to do something, it’s your fault, don’t blame anyone. EC did their part!
17/06/2018, 14:19 - +60 16-475 8556: Nedda ssebo they changed the poling stations ssebo...
17/06/2018, 14:21 - +60 16-475 8556: Ye ani alonda akakiiko ka EC naffe netugoberera.? Hmm naye mwee oli guy yatuwasa mukirize.wano Dr.Besigye nagamba mbu tagya kwesimbawo nga tebakakyusiza...olwamala yakola atya?
17/06/2018, 14:21 - +60 11-2803 7720: No one.
Is to blame. 
Ekibila e Namanve Kyali kiyamba ani? Coca-Cola ewa abantu 5000 emilimu. Families depend on it. It’s better than bricks that were being laid in the swamp. 

Bannange, to me, the industrial village in Namanve has more advantages compared to the forest that existed before.
17/06/2018, 14:22 - Eria Kamya: It's not about doing their part. They should do everything if they want us to perceive them competent. They should do everything!!! That's how your mentality has made our institutions to be mediocre institutions. It's their mandate. Period!!. I should just come to vote. Simple!! By registering to vote, that's enough for me.
17/06/2018, 14:23 - +60 16-475 8556: Kale wulira ngambe nti tomanyi mugaso gwa kibira oba nti ogyerabide boss?
17/06/2018, 14:23 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
17/06/2018, 14:23 - +60 11-2803 7720: To me, this doesn’t make sense. 
When the institution does their part, they have done what is required of them. If you fail to validate your name on the register? How will you vote, 
Brother, I have reservations for you.
17/06/2018, 14:23 - +256 755 911999: My dear have you heard of sinking cities??? Drainage is a big part of the city....do not destroy permanent things fir temporary pleasures. With proper planning I don't see why factories should be put in wetlands when their vast chunks of land laying idle
17/06/2018, 14:24 - Eria Kamya: Of all the dry land in Uganda and baganda for strategic reasons, did they have to put the factory in a wetland?? 🤔🤔
17/06/2018, 14:25 - Eria Kamya: On point dia 🤝💪
17/06/2018, 14:25 - +60 11-2803 7720: Simple, it’s what the government owns. Unlike oyagala bajja batwaale bu puloti bwamwe ate mukube enduulu?
17/06/2018, 14:26 - +60 11-2803 7720: With due respect, 
Drainage is now artificial. There are manmade rivers and drainage systems in cities that do this. 
The issue of swamps doing drainage is so 19th century.
17/06/2018, 14:26 - Eria Kamya: Who told you that Coca-Cola couldn't buy land on dry land??  You're saying that it's what the government owns. Are you trying to say that Coca-Cola Uganda is government owned??
17/06/2018, 14:28 - +60 11-2803 7720: You don’t get it! 
Probably you haven’t been to Namanve and don’t know how UIA got the land in Namanve and how it was distributed. 
Google about UIA Namanve industrial park.
17/06/2018, 14:28 - +60 16-475 8556: Mukulu Daaki the good thing we all Ugandans ...but if you go on with that mentality okwogera nga omuntu wawansi tomuwa weyesigama olowoza buli omu alina sente oba mulamu...ssebo olina okuwa "nabalema" chance webetayiriza kuba tebasobola kulinya "maddala" atenga bebangi...ate bebalonzi

17/06/2018, 14:31 - +60 11-2803 7720: Ssebo Nze ndi muntu wawansi ela nze omu kubalwanilila eddembe lyomuntu wawansi. 

Tulina kwelanako kwesitula financially and physically instead of blaming government for everything thing.

Twasalawo twekolemu omulimu Tulane kulinda Gavumenti.
17/06/2018, 14:31 - Eria Kamya: Don't make Uganda be like a fool who learns from their mistakes. Why go for artificial drainage systems when we have the natural ones??  Isn't it being ridiculous??  We even have living examples of countries who are now resorting to artificial systems having messed up with the natural systems and and you also want us to follow like ducklings??  And then after around 20 years then we spend money constructing artificial systems?? Ahaaa
17/06/2018, 14:33 - +256 755 911999: Have you noticed a change in the weather pattern lately??? World over because of the destruction of mother nature?? Please know that no matter how much we invest in the artificial natural is also better. Read what Stephen Hawking said about artificial intelligence. We marvel in these artificial things and all this intelligence but it will be the downfall of the human race
17/06/2018, 14:33 - +256 755 911999: Always*

17/06/2018, 14:38 - +256 755 911999: Let us get out of this thing of copying. We have copied too much look where that has gotten us....no where....just having wide spread poverty and ratchet diseases...
17/06/2018, 14:38 - +60 16-475 8556: True man heheheh gugeenda negwaaka notya nokutya nti oba enjuba egeenda kwabika...naddala parts of nakasongola and also eastern hoooo
17/06/2018, 14:40 - +60 11-2803 7720: I agree with you. 
I know that weather patterns are changing. But do you think weather is changing because of tampering With wetlands, entirely not. 
Look, most modern cities are built by concrete, the production of cement emits more CO2 emissions, talk about the cars we drive, the electricity we consume, the means of cooking, the fossils fuels we use in aviation, ships and transport. 
Now those contribute more to climate change and we are using them every day.
17/06/2018, 14:40 - +60 16-475 8556: But all yo views are good though sm are better in a democratic govt with independent bodies.or institutions
17/06/2018, 14:44 - Eria Kamya: These emissions are worsen our life when the natural vegetation and drainages are no longer in place. 

Now part of mabira waa given up to sugar factories. But every year, the sugar prices have to hit atleast 6000. Is this a good opportunity cost for the part of the natural mabira forest that was given up?
17/06/2018, 14:44 - +60 16-475 8556: He he he he me am not a specialist in climatic changes but what I studied is....if you tamper with green...Co2 accumulates in the atmosphere...yet even us beings we need oxygen which plants produce after photosynthesis...so if cut them down...automatically dats y endwadde teziggwa mu baantu coz of lack of enough oxygen in body cells...wakireba...
17/06/2018, 14:47 - +60 16-475 8556: If your body cells lack oxygen..they suffocate so to reduce co2 in atmosphere you need green coz they consume it
17/06/2018, 14:48 - +60 11-2803 7720: Brother. Nothing causes disease like poverty. You may agree or not, obwavu bulwadde. 

I am actually sure there are much more sick people in Kampala than Newyork. 
There is more green in Kampala than in Newyork. 
The problem is poverty

Most of the tragedies we see have something to do with human activities....that said we also know that people in Uganda today sell cabon points gaining from emissions by planting trees that use carbon dioxide and give off oxygen.

DON'T SEND IT BACK PASS IT ON

This is the thing these days, with people out of work and needing cash (mainly for drugs!).  Beware, it's headed your way. Just last weekend on Friday night we parked in a public parking area.  As we drove away I noticed a sticker on the rear window of the car.  When I got home and took it off, it was a receipt for gas.  Luckily my friend had told me not to stop as it could be someone waiting for me to get out of the car.  

Then we received this email yesterday:  WARNING FROM POLICE: THIS APPLIES TO BOTH WOMEN AND MEN. BEWARE OF A PIECE OF PAPER ON THE BACK WINDOW OF YOUR VEHICLE (A NEW WAY TO DO CARJACKING!)(NOT A JOKE!) Heads up everyone!  Please, keep this circulating.You walk across the parking lot, unlock your car and get inside.  You start the engine and shift into reverse.  When you look into the rearview mirror to back out of your parking space, you notice a piece of paper stuck to the middle of the rear window.  So, you shift into Park, unlock your doors, and jump out of your car to remove that paper (or whatever it is) that is obstructing your view.  When you reach the back of your car, that is when the carjackers appear out of nowhere, jump into your car and take off.  They practically mow you down as they speed off in your car. And guess what, ladies ?  I bet your purse is still in the car! So now the carjacker has your car, your home address, your money, and your keys.  Your home and your whole identity are now compromised!BEWARE OF THIS NEW SCHEME THAT IS NOW BEING USED.If you see a piece of paper stuck to your back window, just drive away.  Remove the paper later!  And be thankful that you read this e-mail.

I hope you will forward this to friends and family, especially to women.  A purse contains all kinds  of personal information and identification documents, and you certainly do NOT want it to fall into the wrong hands.Please keep this going and tell all your family and friends!

DON'T SAY ME I DON'T HAVE CAR YET, BUT WHAT OF UR RELATIVES? 
PASS IT ON.

Museveni Named Among Best Presidents in the World.

Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni  has been named among the best Presidents in the world in terms of influencing momentous economic growth in his country.
According to a report released by New York University Economics Professor, William Easterly and World Bank Economist Steven Pennings, President Museveni is among the best leaders on the list of leaders estimated to have had a significantly positive effect on their countries' economic growth.
Easterly and Pennings define the best leaders as any leaders for whom the estimated leader effect is positive and significant at the 95% level and the worst leaders are those with negative and significant leader effects.
Out of the 24 world leaders listed in the report, Museveni who has been President since 1986 comes as 12th best President, above many powerful leaders in the globe such as Lee Kuan Yew, former Prime Minister of Singapore and Park Chung-hee, former President of South Korea who served as the President from 1963 until his assassination in 1979.

27/06/2018, 19:27 - +256 701 406572: Russia 2018 World Cup exposes Africans' rigidity 

By Wallace M

I have taken particular interest in watching the performance of African teams at the Russia 2018 World Cup.

Interestingly, Africa has scored only three goals so far with each of our teams save Senegal losing their match mostly in the dying minutes of the game.

I have observed that even with so much attacking talent, African teams love to defend. 

It is as if they go into the game to maintain the same result before the game.

Learning from the way African teams play, I have noted that their play is not different from the way most Africans approach life.

Africans love to defend their status.

They keep unproductive pieces of land for generations, they shun business events, they defend irrelevant customs, traditions, they stick to economic activities that keep their poverty intact. 

An African will defend a worthless job till retirement. 

Africans are afraid to attack poverty and will find every reason to defend their sorry state. 

There is very little to celebrate in Africa because we do not win. 

Examine yourself.

What do you defend in your life? It is exciting to attack. Attack changes results, it brings euphoria, it makes life worth living. Start attacking what keeps you miserable now.

Watching Tunisia with all their attacking talent, speed and energy, I was left wondering why they opted to defend only to concede a heartbreaking last minute goal from the team that chose to attack.

Learn the bad lesson of defending from the African team and choose attack as your lifestyle. 

Am off to attack!
27/06/2018, 19:45 - +256 701 406572: <Media omitted>
27/06/2018, 19:50 - Eria Kamya: My question is; did too much attacking help Germany? Even Manuel Neuer has learned a lesson about attacking. Had he stayed back in his goal, they'd have salvaged something probably. 

African teams have not been won due to defensive plays. We need to appreciate that these European and South American teams haven't just bumped into soccer. They prepared way back. They invested. African governments don't want to invest in soccer because they're afraid of the impacts of football to their economy. This is because they want to have full control of the economy, tune it to their interests and hold people  desperately.

28/06/2018, 13:12 - +60 16-475 8556: TIPS ON HOW TO REMAIN POOR (Prof. Makau)

1. Never wake up early. Keep stretching and turning in bed until you get too hungry to continue dozing. If there are no bed bugs, why hurry to get up? 

2. Never plan how to spend your money. Whenever you get money, start spending it right away and when it's finished, you try to count and recall how you spent it. 

3. Don't think of saving until you have real big money. How can you save when you earn so little? Those telling you to save are not sympathetic to your burning needs. 

4. Don't engage in activities usually reserved for the "uneducated". How can you, a graduate, engage in petty trade, network marketing or home-based production? That's for people who never went to school! 

5. Don't think of starting a business until an angel comes from heaven and gives you capital. How do they expect you to invest before you get millions? Even though more than half the businesses in your town were started with little capital, you as a smart person can only start with millions. 

6. Complain about everything except your own attitude and laziness. Blame the system, the government and the banks that refused to lend you money. They are all bad and do not want you to get rich. 

7. Spend more than you earn. To achieve this, buy consumer products on credit and keep borrowing from friends and employers. 

8. Compete in dressing. Make sure you're wearing the latest clothes. Intimidate the congregation with your trendy fashions every day. Whenever your neighbor buys a new phone, you get one that is more expensive. 

9. Get yourself a nice second hand car that costs more than three times your yearly salary. 

10. Give your children everything they ask for since you're such a loving parent. They should not struggle for anything because you do not want them to suffer that way, they will grow up lazy and hence poor enough to ensure they can't help you at old age.

11. Devote your time, energy and resources to watching football especially EPL, UCL and La Liga. Keep up with all matches, fixtures and transfers. Ensure you adequately argue your points among friends for hours after each game. After all, one day Messi and Ronaldo will remember you and send you some percentages of their income.

12. Stay on Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp and Instagram all day to post, comment or watch videos. Engage in discussions that add no value to your life just to be seen that you are current and up-to-date. Be hopeful that one day a benevolent spirit will come down to bless you.
28/06/2018, 19:04 - Eria Kamya: Senegal also out of world cup, with everything on their side apart from having many yellow cards. That was all for Africa's representatives in this world cup. 😥😥

28/06/2018, 19:06 - +256 701 406572: The end of the road for all African teams
28/06/2018, 19:24 - +256 701 406572: I am hating football indeed. This is worst WC I have ever watched. At first it missed Italy, Netherlands and Cameroon and Ghana. Then I thought technology will help African teams only for men in the centre to refuse to award a winning penalty to Senegal. At least no referees in Atheletic which I am gonna support.
28/06/2018, 19:30 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣 welcome to the defiance world. For me I love the technology. But I didn't watch the Senegal match. However this japan game also had drama. The guys played for around ten minutes while passing the ball only around four defenders. It was a risk as they hoped that the results elsewhere remained 1-0.
28/06/2018, 19:42 - Eria Kamya: But the VAR was absolutely right not to award that penalty.
28/06/2018, 20:30 - +256 701 406572: Did you add the word absolutely accidentally? When he run to consult the IT department!!!! Forget the useless Commentators who are impartial tailored to  change opinions of non soccer experts
28/06/2018, 20:50 - Eria Kamya: Why do you bring in commentators?  In this case it's about the decisions of referees that absolutely matter. Commentators are simply like the media, reporting what happens as it happens. These decisions are what matters most.
28/06/2018, 20:53 - +60 11-2803 7720: Idk why I am asking this, but what is VAR? 
Is it the new name for football referees?
28/06/2018, 21:02 - Eria Kamya: Video Assistant Referees  (VAR)
28/06/2018, 21:03 - +60 11-2803 7720: I googled. 
But thanks 🤣🤣🤣🤣
28/06/2018, 21:04 - Eria Kamya: They're the ones who are responsible for instantly providing a clear, close and multi angle replay. They also are supposed to tell the referee in case he ignores something serious.

 Achievements are just accumulating in Rwanda yet for us we're busy introducing social media taxes after which we brag with peace achievements. A country that was once emotionally torn apart by a genocide would be busy strengthening their security. But they've learnt that gone are the days of such. They've resorted to robust developments. 

And the insecurities in Rwanda were recent. Just in 1994. We're still pursuing and celebrating peace and security since 1986.

30/06/2018, 09:25 - +60 17-364 3269: Hhhmmmm
30/06/2018, 09:26 - +60 17-364 3269: Let uganda a focus on Kiira
30/06/2018, 09:26 - Eria Kamya: You mean Uganda has an engine factory? Or a tyre factory? " No one should deceive you that it's made by Ugandans
30/06/2018, 09:26 - +60 17-364 3269: No one is going to invest in uganda now
30/06/2018, 09:26 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes they have a kiira motors plant
30/06/2018, 09:27 - +60 17-364 3269: But hmmm it’s working slow
30/06/2018, 09:27 - +60 17-364 3269: Anyway uganda is going to become the poorest country in east Africa soon
30/06/2018, 09:28 - +60 17-364 3269: While nrm supporters r still singing m7 brought peace
30/06/2018, 09:28 - +60 17-364 3269: Hmmmmm
30/06/2018, 09:28 - +60 17-364 3269: The engine n tyres r not made by Ugandans
30/06/2018, 09:29 - +60 17-364 3269: It’s just the car assembly  , something
30/06/2018, 09:29 - +60 17-364 3269: Like they
30/06/2018, 09:29 - +60 17-364 3269: That
30/06/2018, 09:29 - Eria Kamya: You just wait to start importing vehicles from Rwanda. That's when you'll realise that Kiira is nothing. At this time we need partnership so as we can bridge some gaps. Then we can start our own things later.
30/06/2018, 09:31 - +60 17-364 3269: Ugandans won’t b able to afford those cars . China won not by bringing outside things but by creating there own things . Nigeria is doing so , they make there own cars .
30/06/2018, 09:31 - +60 17-364 3269: Kiira can work if well managed
30/06/2018, 09:31 - +60 17-364 3269: It’s Ugandan , there 4 all the profits stay in uganda
30/06/2018, 09:31 - +60 17-364 3269: While the Rwandan one , the profits go back to Europe
30/06/2018, 09:32 - +60 17-364 3269: But it’s a start for Rwanda
30/06/2018, 09:32 - Eria Kamya: Kagame is smart. Just know he's not like M7
30/06/2018, 09:32 - +60 17-364 3269: M7 trained ka game
30/06/2018, 09:33 - +60 17-364 3269: Kagame
30/06/2018, 09:33 - +60 17-364 3269: M7 is smart n he knows the right thing , he chooses not to do it , bse he did it b4 in 86 but now he is engulfed in power .
30/06/2018, 09:34 - +60 17-364 3269: He is not stupid , he knows the right thing , he chooses not to do it
30/06/2018, 09:34 - Eria Kamya: We have a saying. *Your child can sound a drum for you and you find yourself dancing to his beats.*
30/06/2018, 09:34 - +60 17-364 3269: Yea I know that .
30/06/2018, 09:34 - +60 17-364 3269: But it does not mean m7 is not smart
30/06/2018, 09:34 - +60 17-364 3269: He is
30/06/2018, 09:35 - +60 17-364 3269: M7 knows the right thing to do , he chooses not to do it
30/06/2018, 09:35 - Eria Kamya: So if your child fails to pass, will you say he's smart but just wanted to fail?
30/06/2018, 09:36 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes it’s very possible for smart people to fail
30/06/2018, 09:36 - +60 17-364 3269: They fail not bse there not smart but bse they fail to put there smartness to use
30/06/2018, 09:36 - +60 17-364 3269: U can choose to fail
30/06/2018, 09:36 - +60 17-364 3269: Life is all about choices
30/06/2018, 09:37 - +60 17-364 3269: M7 can do the right thing , he can choose to do the right thing , but he chooses not to
30/06/2018, 09:38 - Eria Kamya: If you fail to put your smartness to use, then smartness is beyond your control. You're nolonger smart.
30/06/2018, 09:38 - +60 17-364 3269: If he passed b4 yes
30/06/2018, 09:38 - Eria Kamya: What did he pass
30/06/2018, 09:39 - +60 17-364 3269: If u used once n it worked then ur smart . How u choose to use it there after is ur choice even if u do a mistake it does not make unsmart
30/06/2018, 09:39 - +60 17-364 3269: Common u talk as if m7 does not have achievements
30/06/2018, 09:40 - Eria Kamya: Just give me one
30/06/2018, 09:40 - +60 17-364 3269: PEACE
30/06/2018, 09:40 - +60 17-364 3269: FREEDOM .
30/06/2018, 09:40 - +60 17-364 3269: The first constitution was good .
30/06/2018, 09:41 - Eria Kamya: Did you even know that these are rights?
30/06/2018, 09:41 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes , rights that didn’t exist in amins time
30/06/2018, 09:41 - +60 17-364 3269: So he did bring them into force
30/06/2018, 09:44 - Eria Kamya: Anyway if the only achievements he's got so far are peace and freedom for 32 years, then he should be the chief of defence forces or a security minister. But a president is supposed to achieve in every area or at least try your best.
30/06/2018, 09:45 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes , that’s y i say he knows the right thing to do is to step down but he refuses . He himself talked about it b4 . But he made a choice to forego his promise  just to stay in power . Smartness , does not mean good things . Smartness can be used to do bad things too
30/06/2018, 09:45 - +60 17-364 3269: He is able to rub the country for 32 years
30/06/2018, 09:46 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
30/06/2018, 09:46 - +60 17-364 3269: No one does that u less ur smart enough to fool the whole country
30/06/2018, 09:46 - +60 17-364 3269: 😂😂😂😂😂😂

30/06/2018, 10:35 - +60 16-475 8556: With his opponents...Besigye n the rest brainwashing usss...that there's freedom to political party politics and speech while a few were antagonised by their regime...live everyone knows it....if its freedom let it be absolute freedom not to terminate those who refute to be corrupted eg judicials...fellow military and in shadow cabinet...while fighting hiv and indirectly accelerate it through poverty....what's that....
Let her talk discuss smthn else coz now the regime is in negative if it's a graph of integers...
30/06/2018, 10:41 - Eria Kamya: The freedom is soon dying out. After taxing social media, they'll soon ban it.
30/06/2018, 10:42 - +60 16-475 8556: Man dat tragedy is intolerable bro..
30/06/2018, 11:14 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes , I said he did something good n now he has chosen to do bad
30/06/2018, 11:14 - +60 17-364 3269: That’s the point .
30/06/2018, 11:47 - +256 701 406572: Thanks bro Kamya but why is it that whatever little Rwanda achieves, it makes headlines in Uganda's social media not other countries neighbouring Rwanda? Rwanda is not at economical war with Uganda and will never overtake Uganda. But this jealousy is like cold war competition between USA and USSR. Moscow wanted to make headlines by undertaking big projects like arms race, astronomy, big dams and buildings, etc and left the essential items. This made Soviet Union collapse in 1989 coz it was feeding more than it could chew. China on the other hand revolutionarised farming, made factories selling match boxes, toothsticks,  and other house hold items and GDP grew. Big industrial plants by themselves followed having laid the ground. OWC is revolutionarising Agric in Uganda. Load shading has become history now compared in 1990s. Imagine a Kilo of beans in Mbale is now at 800 and Maize still at 600 but may drop to 400 if harvest ends. True Rwanda will get taxes  (after 10 year's tax holiday as profits go to Berlin) but will continue to buy our milk and food on daily basis. If you are neutral and stay in Kisoro,  common sense will teach you which country has better opportunities as seen by refugee movement. Which direction do they go? The direction of movement of economic and political migrants point to standard of living without going it GDP statistics. Otherwise I wish Kigali well to raise their income to buy our products on daily basis as Saudis sell oil to buy USA goods like food
30/06/2018, 12:48 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: <Media omitted>
30/06/2018, 12:49 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: I love this woman’s strategy. Best I have ever seen. Even if it’s me why wouldn’t I do so???
30/06/2018, 12:51 - +60 11-6111 5832: Stoooop it Michael 😩😩
30/06/2018, 12:54 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Man I didn’t know that some people own uganda. Am here suffering looking for jobs and being chased while some idiots have employed there family and relatives
30/06/2018, 12:57 - +60 11-6111 5832: You should know more my friend. The politics of Matooke land has turned into this. It is a wake up call to others. Such is happening in every institution and companies. People are watching. Soon or later those traits will have no room in +256
30/06/2018, 13:04 - Eria Kamya: Some good points from you bro, and thank you for them. However, it's no longer a comparison between the two countries. If it was a comparison, then I would be downgrading Rwanda. 

You talked about load shading and you forgot the price. 

You also talked about the price of maize and beans and I wondered a lot. Firstly , if the price of beans/maize be at 800/600 and it drops to 400 when harvesting ends?  Secondly, is that what you want Ugandans to get out their season's hard work? Do you even know the price of maize flour? Does it make sense to you when someone sells their maize at 400 and then (other citizens) buy maize flour at 2500? 

You also said that Rwanda will continue buying food from Uganda on a daily basis. (The same applies to the electricity that we export to our neighbours.) Maybe you think food can be monopolised by Uganda. What you should know is that a developed country can never worry about food. Instead you'll see us worried about food. Remember it's not something you can monopolise. Before you know Congo and Tanzania will be our good competitors here. I think you're aware that most of the Malaysian food is imported. But all the countries that export to Malaysia still dance to Malaysia's beats. Furthermore, the prices of agricultural products are determined by buyers not sellers. You should also be wondering why a country that relies on us for food is developing so fast. This will give you a simple insight. 

You also talked about refugees. It's good that we're a reliably hospitable country. However these refugees pose a lot of questions. It's not worth celebrating. It's neither an achievement. It's something worth worrying about. Refugees don't come because of a good standard of living. When you're fleeing trouble, you'll go anywhere. So please don't ever say that refugees come for opportunities. This is quite ridiculous. Unless you're mocking them. You also want to say that the refugees in Northern Uganda came for better opportunities. Yet even a big portion of them are Ugandans 🤣🤣🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂
30/06/2018, 13:10 - +60 16-475 8556: No dats not an excuse....better watch out ...man....or woman...unless otherwise...🤔
30/06/2018, 13:11 - +60 16-475 8556: Better go join them...
30/06/2018, 14:03 - +256 701 406572: We have been buying Rice from Pakistan and Vietnam. Why? Coz those countries use best varieties yielding high quatities to out compete us. I also plant maize and currently, we are harvesting better than ten years ago - thanks to improved seed varieties. Of course farmers won't earn a lot (but better than ten years back) but it will keep inflation low. You can't develop if you have no food security. Google what consumes a lot of Saudi expenditure - food. We have comparative advantage in agriculture even without irrigation and with govt irrigation plans now,  we shall produce more cheaply. Let us be optimistic bro Kamya.
30/06/2018, 14:05 - +60 16-475 8556: Ya true but again the genetically introduced seeds gonna spoil every thing...do u have money to treat cancer? Hmm
30/06/2018, 14:12 - +60 11-2803 7720: This message was deleted
30/06/2018, 14:12 - +256 701 406572: On movement of refugees,  I meant if the two nations are all peaceful. Of course, South Sudan is at war and people are escaping from fighting but what and why are many Rwandese escaping into Uganda on daily basis despite the country doing miracles? Moreover,  youthful productive age bracket? In 1980s,  Eastern Uganda used to export house maids to Kenya but now we have many Kenyan casual workers in Eastern plus students. Let us see abundant opportunities in Uganda. If you now visit Kapeeka Industrial Park, you won't believe. Uganda made Tiles just an example. Those Tiles alone boosted by 12% growth in construction industry can give us more profits than 10 year tax holiday VW assembling plant in Kigali.  Let us begin simple bro Kamya and proceed.
30/06/2018, 14:14 - +60 11-2803 7720: There is a big difference between GM and food adulteration. 
GM foods actually grow through the natural process, they may not have the same food nutrients as organic foods but they certainly grow through the natural process. 
The likability of them causing cancer is so minute.
What really causes cancer is crop handling. Usually crop spraying during cropping seasons and adulteration which is done during post harvest handling.
This can be done on both organic and GM food. 
Yes, GM foods are dangerous as they can cause extinction of organic crop varieties but the probability of them causing cancer is minute.
30/06/2018, 14:15 - +256 701 406572: 👍👍👍
30/06/2018, 14:23 - +60 16-475 8556: Hehehe check ur cancer study properly if you get time....
30/06/2018, 14:24 - +60 16-475 8556: I won't argue over something that manifests
30/06/2018, 14:25 - Eria Kamya: So you want us to begin simple at this time after 32 years?  And the way you're exaggerating the 10 year tax holiday, as if we don't have worse tax holidays here given to our investors 🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂
30/06/2018, 14:25 - +60 16-475 8556: Me don't mix life and politics
30/06/2018, 14:31 - +60 16-639 0643: <Media omitted>
30/06/2018, 14:32 - +60 16-475 8556: M7 rejected the law over GMOz that mps passed...and still pple smuggle GMO inside....I think he made more research than u did....
30/06/2018, 14:39 - +60 11-2803 7720: If you ever heard about PMA in early 2000s
That’s when GM food was introduced in Uganda in 2003 by Makerere University Agric. Research center. Namulonge together with NARO. 
Seed Varieties such and Longe 1 for Verna and Nalongo for maize have since then been planted. 
But most GM in Uganda especially in Maize and Beans is made using selective breeding which has been done for centuries rather than Genetic Mutation that was popularised in the late 90s. 
The good thing is, plants are left to grow through a natural process and the soil mechanisms will eliminate all the impurities in the plants.

So, probably all the beans you have eaten for half of your entire lifetime are GM.

Now, I have given you a background about GM you can do some thorough research rather than hearsay.
30/06/2018, 14:40 - +60 11-2803 7720: Replace Verna  with *beans*
30/06/2018, 14:41 - +256 701 406572: True, Capitalism by nature is cruel and we in LDCs pay a big price. I know some factory which got ten year tax holiday and after it's expiry,  relocated to Tanzania. Economic Mafias are real but only way is to develop local entrepreneurship capacity
30/06/2018, 14:43 - +60 11-2803 7720: Secondly, it is government through MAAIF that proposed the GMO bill and MPs rejected it. 
So, by the time the bill came to parliament, it had passed cabinet approval. 
Nonetheless, GMO are there in Uganda supplied by government and were popularised during the PMA era.
30/06/2018, 14:49 - Eria Kamya: Good that you propose local entrepreneurship. But I don't think my country is really interested in promoting it at all.
30/06/2018, 15:38 - +256 701 406572: Some good piece I got on the fb 👇👇
30/06/2018, 15:39 - +256 701 406572: Long read but worth it.

Solution Mindset

Not having enough, does not mean we have nothing!

In Africa we don’t have enough of most things: We don’t have enough food. We don’t have enough electricity. We don’t have enough clean water. We don’t have enough schools. We don’t have enough foreign exchange. We don’t have enough houses, teachers, doctors, or nurses. We don’t have enough of almost anything you can think of! 

Most people looking for solutions, including governments, donors and entrepreneurs (for profit and not-for-profit), are mostly focused on trying to get us more of what we don’t have, but there is something else we can "do," and always need to remember...

Not having enough, does not mean we have nothing!

One of the first questions I posed when I started blogging five years ago was this: “What do you have in your hand?”

I posed this question at the time also as a statement of my faith. God asked Moses: “What is in your hand?”

And when he answered that all he had was a shepherd’s rod, God essentially said to him: “That is enough for what I need to do!”

And we all know that with the rod, Moses was empowered to even open the Red Sea!

Not having enough, does not mean we have nothing!

When we have little, we must not only try to do what we can, we must also never waste the little we have! 

Extending the capacity of the little we have is @RealEntrepreneurship!

Now the new pathway to entrepreneurial success lies in the “shared economy" business model. By now you have heard stories of young people from around the world who are busy launching amazing businesses with extraordinarily little to start with, compared to what was traditionally expected.

Not having enough, does not mean we have nothing!

You might live in a country where it is virtually impossible to get a loan to start a business, particularly if you are a woman. It might also be that you live in a place where the elite appear to have basically cornered every opportunity for themselves and their families. This is particularly the case when it comes to natural resources-related businesses. 

Getting a job may also be almost impossible, simply because they are not there...

Do not despair!

“What is that in your hand?” ...is enough to get you and your friends going!

I know one thing that is in your hand: You now have a smartphone or access to the Internet, otherwise you and I would not be talking to each other on FB! A smartphone (even a cheap Android one) is enough to launch you into business. (Senior class, you know this).

Now who can tell me what I mean by the “shared economy” business model? (Senior class, it is now your turn).

Not having enough, does not mean we have nothing!

As we have discussed here before: Businesses like Uber, AirBnB and Tencent are all created and built around the concept of the “shared economy" business model.

The next millionaires and billionaires in Africa are those who master the business models of the “shared economy” and use them to leverage efficiencies in the use of our continent's meager resources.

Consider this: Over 40% of farm produce in Africa is lost long before ever getting to consumers. This is called “post-harvest losses.”  If we eliminated just half this waste, the impact would be phenomenal, beyond imagination.  

Imagine as an entrepreneur, if you study this problem (as some are doing right now) you can have amazing opportunities. Some of the most exciting African entrepreneurs today are working in this area: “Ways to reduce post-harvest waste.”

Consider this:  In some countries, nearly 40% of the children are stunted due to poor nutrition. An egg a day will cut stunting by a whopping 47%!

Imagine if we could develop business models (as entrepreneurs) to get eggs, or the benefits of egg protein, into every school!  In India they have programs to try and get a glass of milk and an egg to young children.  

I recently visited a business in Rwanda which produces food for babies specifically to tackle this problem. I love this business! There are hundreds of amazing businesses emerging around the area of agriculture using the “shared economy" model.

During a meeting of an organization called the Giving Pledge a few years ago, I ran into a young man called Brian Chesky who co-founded a business called AirBnB. He is now worth more than $5bn. He was in his early 30’s when I met him, even though he looked much younger!

What an amazing business model! 

__But here is the thing:  A smart young entrepreneur like you can use that same concept to solve other types of problems right here in Africa!  And if you don’t do it, someone will come from America, India or China and do it right on your doorstep...

My fastest growing and most exciting businesses are all based on the “shared economy" business model—they are disruptors of traditional business models. 

How can you as an African entrepreneur take this principle, and use it to tackle some of our challenges?

I want us to focus our attention on businesses that use the “shared economy" business model. This is one of the most important new pathways to entrepreneurial success!

Say to yourself: “I’m on it!”  

Solution Mindset.  Now get rolling!

01/07/2018, 13:15 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Now which childish a u talking about. We were talking about journalist u brought in a president. Is m7 a journalist. I have gone ahead and told u m7 doesn’t run those pages, he hires people to go and play around those pages.
01/07/2018, 13:15 - +60 16-475 8556: Hmm
01/07/2018, 13:27 - Eria Kamya: I didn't know that your arguments were so shallow-minded. You may forgive me for that. The point was this; I asked you that *when did following someone mean their credibility*? That was the point. Simple. This point as a general statement to show you that following someone may be for different reasons not only for your shallow-minded credibility. That's how I came to the president. Simple. When M7 said that he definitely cannot continue as president after 75 yrs, and also said he can't preside over a country where people are killed and the security organs don't know the killers, you still say he's not the one who runs the pages? These are first person statements and they demand action from him. Simple.
01/07/2018, 13:28 - +60 16-475 8556: Kale osiinze mukamawange
01/07/2018, 13:31 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: Kati laba “empunu”eno  ssebo we were talking credibility in terms of journalism and not presidency. No one follows any journalist who isn’t credible for your information. And besides no politician in the world is true to his world, give me one example of any president who is true. M7 long ago told u that he came by guns and will go by guns and u also expect to believe in whatsoever he says. It’s you who has shallow mind cause u don’t read what we be talking about and just bring in something else. Enough of your nonsense ssebo
01/07/2018, 13:36 - +60 16-475 8556: Hmm naye banange...empunu?  Which grade of anger is this..?gd evenimg..

Now UMEME & NWSC already have 18% tax, then service fee, then normal taxes on MM and now extra taxes. For first time in history of Uganda,  every citizen is crying taxes. 😂😂

[01/07 17:46] ‪+971 52 136 4424‬: THINGS THAT MAKE ME GO 🙆‍♂🙆‍♂🙆‍♂

Say you want to send 1,000,000= from Kampala to Mbarara.
1. You head to the Mobile Money Shop, and deposit the Money to your phone number. Deposit charges are free, but you are charged 1% Excise. So you will only be able to deposit 1,000,000-10,000 = 990,000 UGX
2. So you send the money (assume MTN to MTN). MTN charges 2,000UGX, so now I can only send 988,000 UGX, less that by 1% Excise Duty. I can now only send 978,120UGX
3. The person in Mbarara I have sent the money to, will need to withdraw it. MTN charges 12,650=, So they will only be able to withdraw (978,120-12,650) less of 1% Excise Duty. That means the person will only receive 955,815=

The transport to Mbarara is 15,000 by bus. Return fare would cost you 30,000 UGX.
It will be cheaper for you to get a bus, give the individual the money and travel back. If you are one of those who liked the "good old days", they are here again! Take a bus, see your people. Mobile Money is dead and buried.

Also enroll on on-line banking. This means that if u have 1M ugx u can just transfer to ur bank account rather than withdrawing it from Mobile money.....  Then use ATM to withdraw . This way,  u survive the withdrawal fees of  20k using Mobile money.

Paying water using online banking is even free. So u just sit at home and pay. 

You have also saved your fuel consumption to the bank, and the time spent there

So Online banking is the way to go.

02/07/2018, 20:44 - Eria Kamya: Sometimes I really wonder about what's happening in our economy. New taxes are coming up and of course people will have all the reasons to defend them. In the end I always blame the president and I am occasionally attacked especially when I compare with other countries. But as time goes on many people will believe me. We're yet to see more *personal directives* from him because I'm sure some people will no longer accept to be used. They know that they can't face the public after being used and occasionally dumped, yet the one behind it has guaranteed his security wherever he goes. 

 Right now, Uganda is having taxes East, West, North, South and Central. This literally means that it's becoming hard for people to accumulate wealth or capital. Hence less job creation. And of course the government through the concerned officials will say all the lies at their disposal to defend this. (well because they're paid 🤷🏻‍♂) But I remembered one thing, it was until Najib was replaced by Dr Muhattir that people realised that a country can continue with GST removed completely. But you'll find that the previous government officials (through their full-time spokespersons) were always defending it. (They're even willing to defend decisions that they simply heard about in the news because many of them don't meet the president.) That's why I will always disagree with people who say that our president is the only one with vision. (Atleast we can all agree on one fact which holds that he is the one that won the elections. But when it comes to a national vision, unless he's immortal.) Most of our decisions are entirely made by him. The rest (such as the Kasaijas, Akullos, Mutabaazis, Mutebires etc have nothing at all because they know that they're dealing with a dangerous person. It's therefore until you have stepped in the river that you're able to know its depth. A person like Mabiriizi could probably make the best president, you never know. But the facts show that he didn't win. Which is okay and understandable. Another random person who has even never joined politics could also be a good one. This of course means that the usual runners-up in the previous elections are also very much capable. But you find a sober youth, who I expect to be a vibrant person (and who's very much likely to live for another 40-60 yrs) saying that all those ones around the top political positions can not be good leaders.  This reminds me of a chicken which was shown on a certain TV walking without a head.  

Mugabe was forcefully removed from office probably due to his age, and elsewhere someone was voted in at the same age. When he took office, it didn't even take two months to implement his main campaign points. But you find some vibrant Ugandans who even no longer want to listen to people's manifestos. To a person like me who doesn't leave data go the way it came, it means a lot. *So, much as age is just a number, we have Africanised ourselves so much that we don't even want to look beyond what is before us.*
02/07/2018, 21:39 - +256 701 406572: You have mixed up issues my bro. The President and C-in-C just proposed, our elected MPs debated and approved without considering its impact on the economy. Now the same MPs  (today's Bukedde news) want to review these taxes. I am so happy personally for these taxes coz they have impacted on every Tom and Dick whether in village or town. People are United and crying against these irrespective of religion, region, sex or political affiliation. This is first time since I was born that people are looking at issues (taxes) not personality like in developed democracies. I am sure in next elections, it's taxes (economy) which will shape elections not politics of identity. Let us see the positives for growth of our democracy. Now MM businesses are gonna die which had employed many people. Theft of utilities especially water on increase and we all need to tighten the belt. But I know if taxes are put in good use in service delivery, citizens will appreciate.

02/07/2018, 23:51 - Eria Kamya: I understand why you are saying it. All of these issues and taxes originate from the president. Are you trying to say that the mps are the ones who always endorse the switching off of Internet during elections? This shows you who is always affected by these things and also where the social media tax started from. But smart as he is, he uses our legislators who have also already compromised themselves or been compromised. It shows you who starts it because he's always the one mostly affected. It shows you where the social media tax originated from and then thrown to the mps with a standing order. Because there's someone always at a threat about social media. Otherwise what would you expect from nrm mps who know that the tax is from their boss? Because they know that the same guy ordered the switching off of Internet during elections. 

All of us know that it's Magezi who tabled the age limit bill. But a person like me can't be deceived that it was Magezi's idea. Our mps are just there to implement because they're already imbalanced.  I will also remind you of one thing. When general Kale Kayihura's term was renewed, the mps still endorsed it. When your father marries a new wife and you don't like her, you simply risk being disowned and no more school fees. You leave him with his wife until time tells. You remember some nrm mps who were expelled from the party because of having their independent opinions about how certain things are wrongly being done. That's why we see these guys just endorsing some of these things. But I don't think they don't have their independent opinions. 

Recently he said that bail for murder suspects is unacceptable. This shows you what happens behind the scenes. Because that statement shows that someone has already decided. Otherwise he should have said the law needs to be reviewed.  Remember this is even a judicial issue. That's why me I pity with some government officials. Just imagine the same judicial officials are the ones who preside over presidential election petitions. And they're still quiet about the age limit petition. 🤷🏻‍♂You guys don't know what is happening beyond what you see. 

We all know that different generals have always died funnily and these guys fought in the bush war (I don't mean to  imply anything here), then just put yourself in the shoes of someone who was just appointed or elected and later made a minister.  I remember Katureebe panicking the following days trying to show that he's in control and that such issues are up to the judicial system. You see some of you don't take certain statements seriously. A person like Nambooze will slowly start retreating from politics. Yet she's even in  opposition. For that reason, I pity with many others more so the ones in NRM. Because the moment you enter politics you become subject to so many things especially in this government.That's why for me I blame them less because we all know that this is a military regime which has even boasted with certain statements like the Quarter pin statement. 

Now we're going to have   LC 1 elections in the most primitive way. The truth is that every LC can print their own ballots because even primary schools can. But this was rejected. When the EC asked for money, it was not available. But It didn't take them anytime to avail the consultation money for each mp. This is because there's someone giving orders and then finds a way of legalising these orders. Remember these mps also have children and also want to see their grandchildren. 🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂

We invented facebook to enable people allover the world to freedom of information, freedom of association and as well promote there goods and services (an official of facebook in charge of africa based in Pretoria stated).We are shocked that the regime in Uganda is selling our product without our consent.

04/07/2018, 02:48 - +60 11-2895 6258: Dear Government, 

Okay. I have now accepted that the person who bewitched this government has PhD in sadism and witchcraft. How does a group of sane people in government sit down and block LinkedIn? 

LinkedIn is a free educational and employment oriented platform which helps people connect for or find employment locally, and for international and professional entities to communicate with local Ugandan businesses and personnel. Who does this? 

In a country where you have over 50% employment amongst young people, in a country where you have 500,000 people graduating from institutions of higher learning and less than 15,000 can find meaningful employment, how do you block LinkedIn? Who did this? .

President Museveni, your advisers will slowly sink you. They come with all sorts of proposals to please you and also make money from you but in the long run, walayi they are going to sink you in a deep political pit. In 2018, who blocks LinkedIn, skype or any other online platform professionally dedicated to the betterment of society? This is utterly despicable.
 
There is zero sensitivity to the repercussions of such a wild decision. What happens to tax paying experts and tourists who arrive here and wish to connect to their families back home on arrival? Is this the image we want to send out to the world? 

Government, how could you not see how this directly affects the day to day coverage of positive news and pictures from Uganda? Why would anyone want to visit us any more (Tourists and investors). How would hotels, customer driven businesses attract customers or even get feedback to improve their services across all sectors?

How do you compel people to use mobile money to pay the social media tax yet you are taxing that deposit? How do you impose a tax on paying a tax? How do you charge someone who is depositing…and at the same time charge the person to whom that money is directed? 

You have already taxed the deposit…but you still follow it up and tax it on arrival on the other end of the destination? Why are you people making life so hard for ordinary folks who barely can survive?

You MPs determine your salaries and have given your selves all the privileges this country can offer. Yet you are not ashamed to suck and squeeze the poor people who are struggling to keep afloat?  What a sad day in the history of our country. What kind of financial oppression is this and where does it end?

04/07/2018, 07:13 - TJ Musiitwa: I will agree with just about everyone that this tax is terrible. If the case was to raise more money for the country why place it on services that foster communication?
It would have been better that they place the tax on health detrimental goods like cigarettes, tobacco, alcohol that sort of thing...
04/07/2018, 07:23 - Eria Kamya: I think it doesn't have to be on such detrimental goods. This is someone's right to smoke or take alcohol. Just a reasonable price is enough because it's their own life that they're putting in danger. In fact for a government that is being criticised for high unemployment, then they better reduce the taxes on such goods. But all in all, the reason why everyone has disagreed with government about the new taxes especially for the social media taxes is because it's now getting to people's rights. The same applies to smokers because it's their right to smoke and no need to give them a hard time for their own choices. Good enough it's their health in danger.
04/07/2018, 07:29 - TJ Musiitwa: But I'll raise to you the problem of passive smoking that the cigarette smokers are bringing about in that it affects the health of those around them. Yes it is their right sure but if you go against the majority, not everyone smokes or drinks(per-se)

This is the time our opposition should be on stand to say no enough is enough and then they can riot but hmmmmmmm we don’t see anyone they allow there just to talk on cameras.
04/07/2018, 07:41 - TJ Musiitwa: That alone is something that they should have been looking into.
I also recently discussed with a friend that they way the parliament introduced this tax... in that while it is a way to reduce dependence on foreign aid....there should have  been a more structured release of the tax(again I don't support it) not wake up tomorrow and boom tax.

If they really wanted to raise the money, then what I think is that they should have gone with a trimester or quarterly charging of the tax.

If we have approximately 17 million people using social media,  charge them a single monthly charge every 3/4 months.. hence 17 million X 6k would amount to about 3.4 trillion per quarter. But even after doing all this still comes the issue whereby the lack of transparency is what in the 1st place is dissuading people from paying taxes in all aspects....they pay but little to no advances have been made towards improving the quality of life for Ugandans in general.
Again I'll raise the fact that I firmly am against this social media tax, a rethinking of the way the tax system is in Uganda should be put into consideration
04/07/2018, 07:43 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: @601151418170  have never seen you complain on this forum welcome bro
04/07/2018, 07:43 - TJ Musiitwa: Correction

04/07/2018, 07:45 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: That’s a good analysis though enjoy the rest of your day.
04/07/2018, 07:45 - TJ Musiitwa: Thank you
04/07/2018, 07:45 - Micheal Bolton Ayebs: All in all the tax would have been indirect
04/07/2018, 07:48 - Eria Kamya: This is very true and I actually wanted to bring it in. The same applies to those who drink because they also put other people's lives in danger in one way or the other. You see our government is not strategic at all. They instead choose to go for the policies that affect the poor just to make them submissive. But if you choose to blame government in that way, you might loose. Someone will tell you that also those who misuse use social media also affect other people's lives especially in terms of their reputations, emotional tortures, etc. The truth is that if a lie spreads on social media, it can never be reversed. A lot of things are always said on social media some of which are true while others are total lies. These lies can greatly affect someone's reputation. A simple example: All the people who have been victims of sex tape leaks can never reverse it. However, in some cases these things are not true. But those who misuse social media don't want to to think about other people's reputations. That's why if you start taking it to such a direction, Government will have all the reasons to tax social media.

They infringe on people's rights to freedom and communication but leave things that harm the society in one way or another because most Ugandans out of frustration will just go n drink some beer and try to drown their sorrows... As for misuse of social media in the example of nudes and the like as an adult you are responsible for your life unless you have been hacked or something the first confidentiality clause one has is with oneself. Why are we allowing foreign behaviour to infiltrate our community... The lack of originality was the beginning of nudes why should you be sharing naked pictures of yourself with people??? Or pictures having sex or things like that??? It's uncouth... Those are personal matters and if a person fails to keep them personal people should not have to suffer for them. As for the wrong information...I blame government. Many times they do things behind closed doors without allowing the media to feature... This is wrong it hinders flow of information and allows people to twist information. If media houses are to get information they should get it from the horse's mouth but if the horse doesn't invite the media then the media will seek out alternative means because thats their job to keep people informed. If media houses were invited it would be easy to regulate spread of rumours and all but because sometimes they also get from grapevine it causes all this wrong information....

04/07/2018, 17:49 - Eria Kamya: I just seen two news posts and I am really happy about it. Both came from the state minister for finance. 

He said that the 1%tax was effected erroneously. This has given me some hopes that maybe something positive will be done about these taxes. In the other post, he said that the Uganda airlines is yet to be revived come April next year. This is great news too. 

Now my dear friends especially those who don't want us to blame the government. I think you're seeing the fruits. I'm certain that public pressure has awakened our leaders. Especially in these two issues. Government will realise that the taxes won't be collected as expected especially the mobile money taxes. And of course as we all know, increase in unemployment was impending. The same pressure about Uganda airlines must have exposed their incompetence in leadership. That's why I really like to compare our country with Rwanda. This was a total shame. And I wonder why some of you don't want us to compare ourselves with Rwanda. According to me, this is key in exerting pressure on them, to do the right things but not to panic because they know the right things. So those of you who want us to keep quiet, such things wouldn't be heard of the government and life would continue in the negative direction. It was also good that the UN airbase was threatened to be relocated to Nairobi. This also showed them what we mean when we blame them. I wish UN had threatened to relocate the airbase to Rwanda. 

When we talk about the bad things in our leadership, we don't intend to simply criticise them, but to advise them because they have absolute control of our resources and that we chose them because we trusted them. Those of you who don't want us to blame them, you're not only enemies to them but also to the whole nation.

04/07/2018, 18:02 - Eria Kamya: Of course their confusion is not new to us. But the confusion is caused by someone who puts pressure on them. Of course you know him. That's why they pass these policies without thorough reviews. In the end they don't know what to say. Remember how kasaija got short of answers yesterday on nbs and chose to instead become angry at the host to the extent of leaving the show. It's because they don't have answers because orders are from above. The Ed of UCC was asked and his answer was that the social media tax has already been effected in other countries. 🤣🤣 As if we do what other countries do.

04/07/2018, 18:29 - +256 701 406572: That's true. Exchange of ideas is what even NRM believe in and call it constructive criticism. Like I said earlier,  these taxes have awaken and united Ugandans to discuss issues affecting their way of life. Not in old days when they used to discuss partisan politics, tribal or religious differences. The pressure has been too much and it was a matter of time for Finance Minister to revert some aspects of the taxes. I know, more good things will come and let us be opportunistic that popular voices can shape public policies. It will make even govt offer good services coz it's only this budget since colonial hut taxes and graduated taxes that ordinary people now know the implications of budget speech.
04/07/2018, 18:44 - +256 755 911999: Dear Ugandans, 
Greetings. I am using social media to share with you the reasons for the social-media tax and the mobile money tax.

Our budget for this financial year is Ug.Sh 32 trillion. The taxes collected from within Uganda and the other fees for this financial year will be Ug.sh.17.5 trillion. The balance (the difference) is handled by borrowing from outside the country, Ug.Sh 8.3 trillion, as well as borrowing from within the country, Sh 7 trillion. We, then, also get grants from outside to the tune of Sh280bn i.e 0.28 trillions.

Why do we have to borrow or beg from outside or even borrow from within? We do so because many people who are supposed to pay tax do not pay the tax. How do we know this? We know this by using the standard measurement used all over the World. This is the GDP: tax ratio. This means the amount of taxes paid compared to the size of the GDP, the size of the economy. 

In 1991, it was only 4% of GDP. When we formed the URA, it rose to 12% and it has stagnated there for a long time. Last financial year it rose to 14.2%. In other countries in Europe, the GDP: tax ratio is 30% or more. The avarage GDP: tax ratio in Africa is 18% . Why is the GDP: tax ratio in Uganda so low? The following are the reasons: 

(a) telephone companies have been under-declaring calls until recently when we acquired machines to see the telephone calls ourselves. Big shame to the culprits; 
(b) Many of the people who should be paying taxes of incomes from rent do not pay or underpay;
(c) Many citizens are still in subsistence agriculture (okukolera olubuto kyokka, Itiyo pi ikeni ) and informal sector (juakali) and I always oppose taxes on those sectors (gonja roasters, mchomo sellers, mechanics, carpenters etc); in any case, it is difficult to know how much they earn;
(d) Absence of scanners on the borders allows false declarations of goods in containers. The URA now has 4 scanners only. I have directed them to buy enough scanners to cover all entry points by land, water and air; and 
(e) Slowness in introducing electronic stamps to the goods imported from outside at the factory level. 

We, therefore, end up getting revenue from consumer taxes on mainly luxuries, income tax, profit tax and import tax on consumables minus the production inputs only. That is why we end up with the low GDP: tax ratio of only 14.2% and have to borrow or beg, yet our economy is growing. 

Coming specifically to the social media and mobile money taxes, Ugandans need to ask the following questions: 
1. When you post or send communication on social media platforms like Facebook or whatever, is it for free or do you pay? 
2. Do you send mobile money for free or do you pay? 
3. If you pay, whom do you pay? 
4. Do you pay in dollars or in local shillings? 
5. If you pay in local shillings, do the ones you pay, most of whom are foreign companies, take money out of Uganda in local shillings or in dollars? 
6. If it is dollars, who earned those dollars? 

Let us answer the last question first. Those dollars are earned by us who produce coffee, tea, the milk products, by our gold, by our tourism, by our processed fish , by our manufactured goods (e.g cement, textiles, soap, mattresses, cooking oil, etc). 

Therefore, some of us, myself included, either earn the dollars or save the dollars by producing products instead of importing them, but some of our countrymen donate those dollars back to the foreigners by chatting endlessly on the social media. Is this correct or fair? Is it good for our country? 

Mobile money transfer is, of course, different from the social media chatting. Social media chatting is a luxury by those who are enjoying themselves or those who are malicious. 

Mobile money transfer, on the other hand, is a useful service. Since the informal sector (juakali, mchomo selling etc) is never taxed and I am always against those direct taxes on those sectors, is it too much for users of the mobile money senders and receivers to also make a modest contribution to the development of their country? The 1% was a miscommunication. The actual figure was 0.5%, half of one percent. That is what we should debate, on the mobile money. 

As to social- media tax, all the moral reasons are in favour of that tax. The social - media users have no right to squander the dollars I earn from my coffee , my milk etc by endlessly donating money to foreign telephone companies through chatting or even lying and, then, they are allergic to even a modest contribution to their country whose collective wealth they are misusing. 

The same with those who engage in games betting. They bet in local shillings. Since, however, our economy is an open one, the foreign owners of betting machines rush to the forex bureaus, buy dollars, the ones I earned , so as to externalize them. This is what affects our shilling.

The importers of foreign luxury goods- wines, whiskies, artificial hair, furniture, textiles, shoes etc, goods that can be made here, also squander our dollars. Fortunately, on account of our campaigns, the import bill has decreased from US$ 7 billion to US$ 5 billion. That is not enough, however. 

There are no taxes on agricultural products, no taxes on machinery for factories or agricultural machinery , no taxes on raw- materials , no taxes on scholastic materials, no taxes on medicine, no tax on exports, no graduated tax etc. Most of the inputs in wealth and job creation are not taxed because we want people to engage in production. The essentials are never taxed. 

This is to clarify that there is no tax on mere depositing money on a mobile phone account. That confusion should be clarified. The half -percent tax, not 1 percent, is only on the sender and the receiver of money through mobile money. Discuss this. 

I congratulate our Science team for demonstrating that we now have the eyes to see all the goings on in the telecommunication and financial services. No more games.

This capacity will be extended to deal with the criminal pigs that have made it a hobby to kill Ugandans. They will pay. I am, however, interested in a rational and honest dialogue, especially on the half -percent tax on mobile money sending and receiving.

Yoweri Kaguta Museveni.

04/07/2018, 19:18 - +256 755 911999: My question to My President would be ,what about those in the formal sector?
 Who before logging in to a social  media site or deposit a single coin on mobile money.. Have already  paid paid 30 percent of there salary on income tax.. 
When purchasing a phone one pays 18 percent Vat
When one buys airtime. One pays both VAT and Exe duty.. From a perspective  of a person from the formal the new taxes do not widen the tax base they just deepening it on to a small scope.


The president has the power to reduce our excessive administrative expenditure.

Stop the supplementary  budgets that the presidency returns to parliament  every financial year to get

Reduce our defence spending. We are not at war

The money we lose on corruption  alone is almost commensurate to the money we get through foreign  Aid

Yesterday diesel was 3840 today morning it was 3940

These things create apathy

The president  wants an honest  dialogue on the 0.5 percent on mobile money.  
I don't think that debate is needed 
We just need better fiscal discipline  and a more creative URA.. But most importantly  a new President.

04/07/2018, 19:18 - TJ Musiitwa: If the President says that the MM tax is 0.5% but the State minister for finance continues to mention 1% (having sourced this information from the daily monitor online and NTV on YouTube as of a few hours ago), shouldn't we be wondering why stakeholders aren't being informed properly?
Given that the tax was introduced on Sunday with 1% and has been so for the past 3 days...
However I do understand that the words from the President are essentially meant to convey final word, but really does that mean that for the past 3 days using mobile money have been paying extra?

05/07/2018, 22:27 - +256 701 406572: ANDREW MWENDA; THE ARCHITECT OF THE POLITICAL ARCADE OF LIES ON TAX.

By Henry Mutebe 
 
Dear Andrew Mwenda,
I have been reading your post that caused a brouhaha online. As always, anyone reading your ingeniously staked pile of statistics may mistake your canopy of lies for a roof of the house of truth. It takes an ardent and open eye to forage through the mountain of statistics you usually arm your write ups with, in order to decode the lies that; ever present, veil the arcade of lies you sell to your unsuspecting followers. 

Andrew, you are deluded to think anyone who raises up to give their opinion that goes against a government position is anti-government, anti-tax and or ignorant. Far from it, we are pro-government, but perhaps I should add, pro-good government. Most Ugandans who speak out their pains, do so because they want things to be better and they love this country better. Like you love your country and government, we all do, perhaps in different ways. 

While you look at our government developing pimples and you use rhetorical make up to cover the pimples and call it ‘beautiful’, we also love this government but care enough to say, this is a pimple and not a dimple. We care enough and shall; at the risk of being labelled ignorant and or anti-government, always tell our leaders the truth whenever things go wrong and seek for a dialogue on issues we think government can do better.
 
Being pro-government doesn’t necessarily mean spinning. Our government has over 400,000 civil servants. We cannot say we hate our government when its staffed with our brothers and sisters. However, we are honest enough to tell our brothers and sisters that your mouth is smelling, go and brush. You on the other hand, simply just keep saying (literally) that bad breath is a sign that one had dinner. 

Unlike you who, believes in the chaos theory of conflict resolution, because being a journalist, a death is just a figure to report or name to sell in your news, we who do care about what happens to our country, shall never tire in speaking up and asking government to improve in areas we feel can hurt society. 

Let’s examine the merits of the arguments in your last Facebook post. I will be very generous in my consideration and respect for your views, but also keep my arguments within the courtyard of honesty. 

First you argue that citizens are demanding services yet they don’t pay taxes. Now, Andrew, in my view, being stupid is not a crime, but to spread it, I dare, should be morally and intellectually criminal. Who in this country does not pay a tax? Who are you fooling? Who does not know that every time one buys something from a shop, they indirectly pay a tax to government? 
 
It is good (for me), but tragically sad (for you), that you use Norway as example to demonstrate how Ugandans have what in your view, are wild expectations. I lived in that country and have a good appreciation of what goes on there. 
You may want to learn that the governments in those countries (cited) have an irreducible minimum package of services they offer their people which makes their people happy, and I should emphasise, eager to pay taxes.  They can see what their taxes are doing, without the need of a spin doctor (who is also a cost to the state). 

You shrewdly just point to these countries but do not walk down the complete mile of your argument to explain what those governments do differently to make their people love to pay their taxes. Why are Ugandans enraged about paying these taxes? 

To make matters worse, you front the old argument that it’s the rich paying taxes. Oh Please! Do the rich print this money on their own and pay government or they make it from the poor? Where does the money of the rich come from? The so called rich also get their money from the poor. 

Between Sudhir and an ordinary citizen, who needs the Police more? Who has much to loose? Who should pay more? Of course we all know and appreciate that taxes are what Government uses to pay for the services but to simply argue that the rich are paying more is to, in my view, construct a house of lies that will soon collapse under the undeniable weight of the truth.  

The rich pay more because in reality, they get more from the poor. They don’t print their own money. So ultimately, this money is still paid by the poor, through the hands of the rich. 

The fact that they finally pass on some of this money, collected from the poor, doesn’t necessarily make them the ones who are paying as you naively argue. The question then becomes; why don’t people want to pay taxes? But let’s even assume that it’s true that the rich, (you and others), are the ones who are paying more, which country in the world doesn’t have this trajectory? Since you love statistics, let’s go square. 

In 2016, more than four in ten Americans (44.3% to be exact), did not pay income tax.44.3% of American’s population means more than 76 million Americans, like the Ugandans you describe and brutally detest, did not pay their taxes! See?

Okay. Let’s consider the United Kingdom. In the same year (2016), 43.8% of the Britons did not pay income tax. Andrew, I am talking about the United Kingdom. So…if the United Kingdom, that for over 300 years scavenged the world, and vacuumed their resources, developed and matured but still has 43.3% of its population not paying income tax because they consider their incomes minimal to call for a levy, how do you expect Uganda; a baby, in development terms, to have dreamy figures? 

To argue that ‘only about 760,000 people are registered for personal income tax called Pay As You Earn (PAYE)’ is a punch below the belt. You also argue that only 24,600 out of the 236,000 individuals with businesses, are paying taxes and that ‘a miniscule 4,150 pay 80% of it.’ Why didn’t you also show us the figures of how much the rich pay in the developed countries to which you want us to aspire to be? 

The argument that the few are paying bypasses the hard reality of income inequality that is evolving into a cancerous state in this country. In 2012 the world Bank gini index raked us at 42.4% in inequality levels. This means that the level of inequality is too high. The Norway you cite is the third most equal country in the world in terms of income (pa World Bank 2016) after Ukraine and Slovenia. 

The success of your lies, I have come to discover, rests in your genius in perfectly and thoroughly discussing; but half, of your truths. To achieve the 40% tax to GDP level requires acceleration of economic equality. If some people have more and extremely much while others continue to sink in poverty means that you will continue to have the rich pay more and shoulder the burden. 
Even in the UK, in 2016 the top 1% paid about 27% of all the taxes. The reason is that there is generally more income distribution and some form of equality than we have in our country. 

In an article you wrote in 2015, you cited World Bank as having reported that Uganda loses about 500 billion in corruption every year. In the same year, you argued that corruption is good and helps to promote efficiency. Bundling some arguments to achieve your lies, which I challenged, you argued that corruption is good. 

Today, in your article, you again contradict yourself and argue that the tax is good because it will make people wake up and demand for accountability. Which accountability are you talking about? 
In 2015 when we wrote against corruption, you stood up for it and defended corruption, shamelessly sanitizing it. On the one hand you support corruption but again write that this tax will wake up people to start demanding for accountability. 

On Tuesday, your friend Tamale Mirundi smartly used a simple example to illustrate the state of Uganda. He said, as a school (citizens of Uganda), we are fetching water (paying our taxes), but the tank is leaking. How do you expect people t be motivated to pay taxes when what they put is what moves out? 

In my understanding, He used the word leaking to mean that many resources often find their way out of the public purse in dubious, uncultured, illegitimate and corrupt ways. That lost water (money lost in endless corruption scandals), does not motivate Ugandans to love to pay more taxes.
The corruption index 2016 ranked us (Uganda) 151 out of 176 countries in the world. This means Uganda is believed to be the 25th most corrupt country in the world, only beaten by Somalia, South Sudan and a few others. 

In 2016, the very members of parliament who want us ordinary folks to cough out more money in taxes exempted themselves from paying taxes on their allowances. By just passing that law, the revenue body is estimated to have lost over 40 billion that could have been chopped off their allowances like other employees. 

Just recently, government paid out over 9 billion to MPs of the 9th parliament in tax refunds. The MPs want ordinary people to pay but they feel they are too special not to pay these taxes. If MPs do not experience what ordinary folks go through to make ends meet, how wil they legislate hwen their experiences are different? 

How does a person whose fuel is paid for, medical expenses catered for and a fat salary guaranteed whether they come to work once in a month or not. Whether they sleep and say nothing. How do does this elevation make MPs understand what it feels like not be an MP? You don’t have the answers to these questions and I know that you are not responsible for the decisions MPs make but I want you to discard the idea that the people don’t want to pay taxes. How should people pay taxes when those who are planning for them don’t want to pay. 

Consider the wastage of government resources. Makerere University for example, has about 3000-4000 government students at any given time. For the last couple of years, due to the small allocations government gives the university, students on government sponsorship are allocated about 5000shs per day for their meals. It has been like this for years. 

Due to this issue, students keep striking almost every semester over poor meals. To defuse these strikes, the government spends millions of shillings to contain the strikes. The University loses property during the strikes, people loose business and a lot of time is wasted when some of the issues causing these strikes could cost us less than we spend on containing them. 

But I may be duleded…may be it is business for people to have this kind of chaos! Imagine, if government had prioritized and raised this money by 5000shs only to make it 10,000shs, it would cost it just 20 million per semester or 40 million every year. The government spends more money on containing strikes in Makerere than the money it would use to improve student welfare. 

Government beat up MP Nambooze, Hon.Zaake and others. On those two MPs alone, the tax payers had to cough over 300 million just to get medication for them out of the country. Again, Hon. Nambooze is mistreated, she has today been flown for further treatment. We are going to cough more money. So you basically have tax payers’ money being deliberately put to waste because of the actions of some officers of government who should be paying from their pockets for their illegal actions.
  
I am saying all this because it bothers me that you want to blame the ordinary people for the mistakes of government. You also argued that 75% of imports are not taxed. You said many businesses are not paying taxes. Who are you telling? Who should tax those businesses? Should ordinary people set up roadblocks and start levying tax on behalf of URA? The excuses you give are completely baseless. Whose role is it to collect taxes? 
How about the many so called investors who are given obscene tax breaks and holidays? 

You give a foreigner 10 years of tax free business but when your own Wavamuno, a man who has contributed for years to a country’s development, falls in debt or fails to pay a tax, the government doesn’t want to know! Investors come and open businesses here, they make profits although they hide the facts. Once the time is over, they close and either come back as new investors (to be given new tax breaks) or simply pack and leave. Why don’t you also talk about these folks since you are the wisest journalist? Oh please! Save us this bunch of lies. 

In Kenya, you have the finance Minister Dr. Henry Rotitch, a Havard graduate. In Rwanda, you have a PhD economist from Warsaw school of Economics. Ethiopia, same story, Dr. Abraham- PhD economist, then you come to Uganda, we have Anite in the ministry of Finance! Mwenda, understand the roots of a problem. Don’t go for the leaves. I have paid my OTT, but even then, I care enough to tell government that is not right and they can find other ways to increase revenue without hurting ordinary folks. We are not fools to consume your bunch lies.
05/07/2018, 22:27 - +256 701 406572: DEAR MR. MUSEVENI, MATIA KASAIJJA, ANDREW MWENDA, TIM KALYEGIRA ET AL: THIS IS WHY I AM AGAINST #SOCIALMEDIATAX AND #MOBILEMONEYTAX
By Muhereza Kyamutetera
Mr. President, since the infamous #SocialMediaTax and #MobileMoneyTax came into effect, there has been a big debate fueled by anger, about these taxes. Almost everybody has had unkind words about this tax except members of your government (for obvious reasons), yourself and two other gentlemen i.e. my friends Timothy Kalyegira and Andrew Mwenda.
In my estimation, there are two basic arguments being made; one is that social media is a luxury that ought to be taxed (this is a view largely shared by the president alone) and the second common strand is that Uganda is not collecting enough tax to finance the many needs and wants of its population.
First of all, Mr. President, you should fire whoever has misled you about social media. According to latest research, as of January 2018, out of a population of 7.6 billion people, there were 4 billion users of internet (53% penetration). Of these, there were 3.2 billion active social media users (42% penetration), 3 billion people (39% penetration) of whom, accessed the internet on their mobile devices, meaning they were reachable almost 24/7. 
You might not know, but when we are not gossiping we are transacting business on social media. Today, with Skype, I can conduct a meeting with 3 of my partners, one in India, another in the UK and another in the United States- all from my office- all at a cost of less than Shs2,000. 
There is so much e-commerce that we can be able to do and are doing on the various ‘lugambo’ platforms such as Facebook, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram etc. As a key promoter of export-led markets, I am shocked that you think social media is for lugambo. Matter of fact, social media is replacing conventional websites as a communication tool. For example, while the www.statehouse.go.ug website attracts less than 5,000 visitors a month, your Facebook page alone is followed by over 410,000 people from all over the world. 
Imagine what you can sell to these people if you really wanted to!!
You and in fact your entire cabinet need to wake up to the new reality that is social media. In fact you should subject all your key government people to a digital exam and get rid of whoever can’t score 50%, because social/digital is not the future, digital is the present. 
That aside, while I agree with you that Uganda does not collect enough taxes to feed its ever-growing needs, I do not agree with you on your attempts to keep on lumping taxes on one group of the population and the detriment of the other. 
It is true that our tax-to-GDP ratio, at an estimated 14-15%, is too low, and it is believed that it will not grow fast enough to reach the EAC Monetary Union Protocol threshold of 25% by FY2021/22. Again, according to Paying Taxes 2018, a report by PriceWaterhouseCoopers and The World Bank Group, our tax regime is fair, with average tax rates of 33.7% (22% profit-related taxes and 11.3% labour-related taxes) compared to the Africa Average of 47.1%.  While we are at per with Rwanda (33.2%), we are better than Kenya (37.4%), Ethiopia (38.6%) and Tanzania (44.1%), according to the report.
Even in terms of efficiency and tax administration, Uganda does well- it takes about 195 hours on average to comply with most taxes, way better than the 285 hours average for the African continent.
So what is the problem then? Why are Ugandans resisting this minute increase in taxes? 
I did a simple poll on Twitter and out of the 372 people who took part in the poll, the majority (50%) said they did not believe the tax was high but rather, their fears lay in the fact that they did not trust their government to put the additional tax to good use. 
This confirmed a belief that I had earlier and therefore forms the basis of my 5 cents of what I presume to be wisdom. In my view, I do believe that the problem and or the solution lies in addressing the following 2 fundamental things.
1.	Maximising value on the tax paid through increased government efficiency, fighting corruption and funding the appropriate priorities as laid out in national strategies. 
2.	Depoliticizing tax administration by ensuring everybody, including the informal sector (who are seen as untouchable voters by politicians) pick their fair share of the tax burden.  
Speaking about delivering value, I have come to believe that simply increasing the resource envelope will not necessarily result into better life for Ugandans if key fundamentals are not fixed. 
For example, between 2012/13 and 2016/17, courtesy of the tax payers and donors, the resource envelope given to government, was increased by 136.3% from UGX11.6 trillion to UGX26.4 trillion and what did we get? 
The number of poor people in Uganda instead increased by 51% from 6.7 million in 2012/13 to 10.1 million people in 2016/17 according to the Uganda National Household Survey 2016/17 done by Uganda Bureau of Standards (UBOS). According to the same report, the proportion of people leaving below the poverty line grew to 27% from 19.7% in the same period.
Mr. President, what this says is that without focusing on budget discipline and efficiency, simply giving you more money won’t help us a single bit.  
If you cannot fix corruption that according to the IGG reports stands at 97.9%, you should forget that Ugandans, will keep on giving. There is something to learn from countries such as Botswana, Cape Verde, Rwanda and Mauritius where, according to the Transparency International Global Corruption Barometer 2017, less than 5% of their citizens indicated they paid a bribe when they came into contact with a public servant.
In Uganda, our score is 38%.  
Wide gaps between Strategy and execution
Secondly you also need to fix the wide gaps between strategy and execution by your government. While your government has a great vision for Uganda; “a transformed Ugandan society from a peasant to a modern and prosperous country within 30 years- with a per capital income of USD9,500”, we all know that vision/faith without action is dead. 
As the Chief Executive Officer of Uganda Limited, how do you explain that, the 2018/19 budget only mirrored 42% of the National Development Plan II? 
According the Budget Committee, it was extremely difficult to “link the National Budget Framework paper of FY2017/18 and that proposed for FY2018/19. The programme indicators are different hence making it almost impossible to track progress and quality of targets,” they noted. The committee also noted that there was “a great mismatch in alignment of strategic plans for sectors, ministries, departments and agencies as well as local governments to the National Development Plan. Hence the foundations of the National Budget Framework Paper FY2018/19 are inconsistent with the National Development Plan.” 
So basically, we want to go west, but our budgets are financing a North East plan? 
If people do not see value for the little money they are paying, they do not see reason for paying more tax, even if it is just a 1% increment.  
Recently I did an interview with Doris Akol, URA Commissioner General for my blog and this is what she had to say about the relationship between tax compliance and government efficiency and or delivery of services.
“There is a direct correlation between what we call tax morale and tax compliance. Tax morale is the perception that people have that they are getting value for money for the taxes they pay and therefore their enthusiasm to pay tax or to be compliant grows. There is a direct relationship between the tax morale and tax compliance. So when people perceive that they are not getting value for their money, the tax morale will be low.”
Depoliticise tax administration
Regarding the issue of politicization of tax, Mr President, it is high time you reconsidered your ban on graduated tax. With all its issues, graduated tax, provided an easy platform for taxing Uganda’s largely informal sector that is above 50% of GDP. Because tax assessment was done by the local councils who knew very well, the incomes of their village members, it was perhaps the next best perfect alternative to include the informal sector into the taxable fold. 
This is the only way, coffee farmers, tomato growers, milk sellers and people with cattle can be made to pay income tax that can go to their respective districts and that way, the districts can stop exerting pressure on the central government coffers.   
There is a temptation by politicians to confuse farmers with peasants- which is largely responsible for the fact that agriculture which contributes 27% of GDP, only contributes 2% of the entire tax collections! Regardless of your political ambitions in 2023, if you can successfully increase the tax contribution of the agriculture sector from 2% to may be 10%, this country will be able to increase our tax-to-GDP ratios, so you won’t have to heap senseless taxes on us, such as #SocialMediaTax and #MobileMoneyTax. 

Otherwise to think that the same section of the public that is already suffering from high interest rates, high school fees, corruption, employment, high cost of doing business, high cost of private healthcare, high cost of energy, bad roads, government bureaucracy and over and above that, has to subsidize our rural kindred, should now face additional costs in trying to send money or communicate- is a tricky affair.

06/07/2018, 23:55 - +256 701 406572: I was travelling from Kampala to Jinja today when I heard Kadodi music and dance in every centre. I peeped through the window to see the Gishu candidate aspiring to be a man but no sight. Instead,  I saw politicians beings escorted campaigning for Local Council posts. Yesterday in Mafumbira S/Cty, one politician wanted me to broker the deal to get him good Kadodi drummers at Ugs 1M for four hours to escort his nomination. This is a lot of money to pay 250 casual workers in Oil factory in Jinja if they work for 12Hrs. In simple terms the fee can pay for OTT of 5000 Internet users a day. Kadodi is liked coz it suits mobility dancing than any other cultural dance. It's sound penetrates up to the veins and the heart and many ladies abandon food on fire just to try it. Despite this lucrative potential,  Makerere Dance & Drama Dept or Gishu cultural Centre has no plans to teach more youth the skills. The few skilled ones are dying and our educated youth feel it's trade for the less educated.  Burundi has earned big from her traditional drum entertainment world wide. Can't we set up a Centre in Mbale to teach young generation and commercialise it. Already a big market exists in Uganda and Kenya especially during election, wedding and circumcision season. Culture should be improved by existing generations.
07/07/2018, 03:28 - +60 16-475 8556: Very true...and It will induce good competition along side...you know easterners are very good at music and dance as wel...the samya sogies gishu and a few sabin and iteso...I love their styles of music and dance...but Kadodi made me run 5 miles while  I was 7yrs...and returned home at night...🤣🤣🤣 quite interesting dance...commercialising it will be better for our brothers...especially the jobless ones.

08/07/2018, 15:42 - +60 16-639 0643: In the United States, an estimated 5.4 million people have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. This figure is growing rapidly with the ageing population.

One of them was Steve Newport. His wife, Mary Newport, was a doctor. Dr. Mary learned that her husband had severe Alzheimer's disease.

When the doctor examined her husband at the hospital, he asked Steve to paint a clock. Instead, he drew a few circles and then drew a few figures without any logic. It was not like a clock at all!.

The doctor pulled her aside and said: "Your husband is already on the verge of severe Alzheimer's disease!"

It turned out that it was a test of whether a person had Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Mary was very upset at that time, but as a doctor, she would not just give up. She began to study the disease. She found out Alzheimers disease was associated to glucose deficiency to the brain.

Her research says: "The dementia of the elderly is like having diabetes in the head ! Before one has the symptoms of Diabetes or Alzheimer's disease, the body has already had problems for 10 to 20 years."

According to Dr. Mary's study, Alzheimer's disease is very similar to Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The cause is also insulin imbalance.

Because insulin has a problem, it prevents the brain cells from absorbing glucose. Glucose is the nutrition of brain cells. Without glucose, brain cells die.

As it turns out, these high-quality proteins are the cells that feed our body.

But nutrition for our brain cell is glucose. As long as we have mastered the source of these two kinds of food, we are the masters of our own health!

The next question is, where to find glucose? It cannot be the ready-made glucose that we buy from the store. It is not from fruits such as grapes. She started looking for alternatives.

The alternative nutrients for brain cells are ketones. Ketones are necessary in brain cells. Ketones cannot be found in vitamins. 

*Coconut oil* contains triglicerides. After the triglycerides in *coconut oil* is consumed, it is metabolised into ketones in the liver. This is the alternative nutrient for brain cells!

After this scientific verification, Dr. Mary added *coconut oil* to her husband's food. After only two weeks, when he went to the hospital again to do painting and clock tests, the progress was amazing.

Dr. Mary said: "At that time, I thought, has God heard my prayers? Wouldn't it be coconut oil that worked ? But there is no other way.Anyway, it's better to continue taking the*coconut oil*."

Dr. Mary was now part of the traditional medical practice base. She clearly knew the capabilities of traditional medicine. 

Three weeks later, the third time she took him to do a smart clock test, the performance was better than the last time. This progress was not only intellectual, but also emotional and physical.

Dr. Mary said: "He could not do his running but now he can run. He could not read for a year and a half, but he can read again now after taking *coconut oil* for three months."

Her husband's actions had already begun to change. He did not speak in the mornings. Now she noticed a lot of changes: "Now after he gets up, he is spirited, talking and laughing. He drinks water himself and take utensils for himself on his own."

On the surface, these are very simple daily tasks, but only those who have come to the clinic or have demented relatives at home can experience the joy: It is not easy to see such progress!

After frying the greens & onions in coconut oil, making cakes with coconut, after taking 3 to 4 tablespoons of coconut oil per meal, 2-3 months later, the eyes too can now focus normally.

Her studies proved that *coconut oil* can really improve the problem of dementia in the elderly.

Apply *coconut oil* to bread. When coconut cream is used, the taste is unexpectedly good.

Young people can also use it for maintenance of health and prevention, and can improve if they have symptoms of dementia.

Dementia is caused because nutrients cannot be transported to brain cells, and nutrients must be passed from the body to the brain by insulin.

Especially for diabetic patients its not easy to get insulin secretion. “Nutrition cannot get to the brain. When brain cells are starved to death, they are deprived of intelligence.”

*Coconut oil* contains medium-chain triglyceride, which can supply nutrients to the brain without using insulin. 
*So, it can improve Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease*.

09/07/2018, 15:11 - +256 701 406572: "THE BRITISH HAVE GONE MAD AGAIN"

(PERMISSION TO HAVE SEX IS NOT PERMISSION TO EJACULATE😳😳😳😳😳😳😳!)

A woman who agreed to sex might still be a victim of rape, the High Court has ruled. The most senior judge in England and Wales and two other judges said there was consensual penetration, but the man behaved aggressively and ignored the woman’s demand that he should not ejaculate.

The woman had challenged a decision not to prosecute the man for rape and sexual assault.

The judges have ordered prosecutors to review their decision. Prosecutors had decided not to charge him as it would be “impossible to prove” that the man’s decision was not “spontaneous” and “made at the point of ejaculation”. 

Handing down a written ruling, the three judges said the man had been controlling and aggressive during sex. On the specific incident in question the woman consented on the clear understanding that the man would not ejaculate within her vagina. 

The ruling said: “She believed that he intended and agreed to withdraw before ejaculation. He knew and understood that this was the only basis on which she was prepared to have sexual intercourse with him. 
“In short, there is evidence that he deliberately ignored the basis of her consent to penetration as a manifestation of his control over her.” 

Shortly after penetration – and without giving the woman “any chance to object” – the man had said he would be “coming inside her” and had added “I’ll do it if I want”.

Judges were told that the man had “ejaculated before she could say or do anything about it”, and she had become pregnant. Lead Judge, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Mr Justice Fulford and Mr Justice Sweeney at a High Court hearing in London, added: “She was deprived of choice relating to the crucial feature on which her original consent to sexual intercourse was based. 
“Accordingly her consent was negated. Contrary to her wishes, and knowing that she would not have consented, and did not consent to penetration or the continuation of penetration if she had any inkling of his intention, he deliberately ejaculated within her vagina. 

“In law, this combination of circumstances falls within the statutory definition of rape.”

09/07/2018, 21:59 - +256 701 406572: Prof. CASMIR MUSHONGORE RUBAGUMYA has echoed remarks made recently by Ex president BENJAMIN WILLIAM MKAPA who doubles as Chancellor of university of Dodoma. H.E MKAPA said, in March 2018, that our education system is in crisis hence there is an urgent need for a national dialogue on the state of our education.

Prof. RUBAGUMYA has left no stone unturned when discussing the said hot button issue:

"My tenure as Principal at the University of Dodoma opened my eyes to the deteriorating quality of education in the country. The quality of students we received from secondary schools was worse than I had seen at UDSM. Each year we received a worse crop of students than the previous one. Students were unable to communicate fluently either in Swahili or English. The problem was not only the language but also the inability to think clearly, in whatever language."

"Students were also ignorant of basic general knowledge about the world and even about Tanzania. One day I was shocked to learn that a second year university student did not even know the name of the Vice President of Tanzania, something even a Grade 2 pupil would be expected to know. On another occassion, a finalist student whose major subject was Swahili wrote a letter in Swahili which was incoherent. This is of course not something that one may solve at university level. It is a symptom of a bigger, more fundamental problem of the whole education system in the country. Nor was this a problem faced by the university of Dodoma alone. My role as external examiner in Tanzania revealed the same problem in other universities as well".

" These students seem to constitute a different generation, not really interested in the rigours of the academic life. Most students of the current generation would be happy to use shortcuts in order to get their certificates. This approach included bribing their way up the educational ladder from primary school all the way to the university level. Unfortinately, some parents and teachers are part of this dirty game, which explains why we have so many cases of forged certificates at all levels. We also have cases of students who pay people to write their dissertations for them. All these are worrying symptoms of a system that does not work properly."

"Unfortunately, these corrupt practices are not confined to students alone. We also have corruption even in the highest level of government. There are very few people with the moral authority to condemn students involved in these malpractices."

"Where will all this deterioration lead us to? Whenever I visit Dsm nowadays and see so many young people in the streets doing nothing, my heart bleeds. Have we forsaken them? Is there nothing society can do to channel this force to useful purpose? These are people who have nothing to lose and can be easily used by selfish politicians to achieve their ends."

"We will have, over the years, an army of graduates at all levels of the education system with no knowledge or skills, which means they cannot be employed. Some of them will be employed through corrupt practices or because of "technical know who" instead of "technical know how." This situation will fuel incompetence and further corruption in the whole fabric of the society; it is a vicious cycle. We will have a crop of leaders who are only interested in amassing wealth by any means, fair or foul, because that will be the only thing they are capable of doing. It will be a Marcheavellian society where the end justifies the means."

"Top government officials are chauffeur driven in very expensive four wheel drive vehicles. They pay themselves alot of allowances, many of which cannot be justified in any way. The same officials own private property, the grandeur of which is inconceivable in a poor country. Much of this private property is in fact obtained by stealing public funds."

"One day I was amazed to see the Ambassador of Japan accredited to Tanzania being driven in a Toyota Rav 4, a cheap Japanese car. Yet Japan is the third biggest economy in the world after US and China. I cannot imagine an African Ambassador being driven in a Toyota Rav 4. When the Japanese Ambassador goes to sign documents for assisting Tanzania, he meets a government official who is being driven in a much more expensive Japanese car!!!."

"Sometimes I ask myself: why would one want to own 10 cars? You can only drive one at a time. Why would one want to own 10 mansions? You can only sleep in one room at a time, usually in a corner. While it is legitimate to seek to be comfortable in life by earning an honest income, living ostentatiously because of ill-gotten wealth is unacceptable. You cannot enjoy this wealth, especially when you know quite well that people around you are miserable because you have stolen from them. Your conscience, assuming you have one, will always nag you. Education is the key to proper success in life".

10/07/2018, 13:50 - +60 16-475 8556: No u just hate those who play it badly not politics it self coz without it we can't be organised even in Mornachs its politics...

10/07/2018, 13:56 - +60 16-475 8556: U know these are like if anything happens or pple overpower the govt. Then u just bring in Besigye to protect their wealth....thats the reason for creating FDC...both parties are engineered by  himself the president...mr Besigyez role is to prevent any upcoming big politicians or waves . he's like a wall to stop any incoming forces against the govt.thats politically...fdc is another branch for NRM...then the rest they just play it like any movie on T.V to show us that he's against the govt...
10/07/2018, 13:58 - Eria Kamya: You find very vibrant people here but have failed to understand Uganda's politics and propaganda. You will make the future generations to think that politics is a complex thing. Yet it is very simple just that many of you are not learning from what happens in your country. 

Sometime back, the police seriously beat up besigye's supporters. Of course we know who was by then the police chief. As the matter was being taken seriously and gaining momentum from everyone, the president stopped somewhere on the road to take a phone call. This successfully diverted people's attention from police's brutal beating of besigye's supporters, to the comedy of the president making a call on the road. That's when I knew why M7 has been able to rule us for this long. 

Recently during the age limit bill, the land bill was also introduced alongside it. 

Now we're in another scandal and still Ugandans are being diverted. Instead, you're the people who are still making the old man prevail. Because despite his age, he's able to divert you and you also accept to be diverted. If we continue like this, we shall become a laughing stock. Now people are going to forget all the social media news, kayihura saga and instead put their minds on mere propaganda.
10/07/2018, 14:01 - +60 16-475 8556: If yo an opponent to the govt.no govt members will buy from any of yo businesses rather they just shut it down but for these pple shell powerhouses for Besigye still operate and govt officials even police vehicles get fuel from them....me never to vote again when its M7 and mw.Besigye as the main contendant.

11/07/2018, 06:10 - +256 701 406572: Exactly. Some remote places like Siberia in Russia had never seen a black person. Our officers and two from Angola told us how villagers scrambled to touch them when they went there for military field exercise in summer (it was first trip outside Moscow). Some even preeked their skin to see if they too feel pain. Others thought our top layer may go off. But now with all global TV coverage showing these black dominated teams play the beautiful game, the myth dies. It was sweet yesterday coz a black out jumped and headed in the only goal. Commentator tried to divert the praise to transfer to the white who delivered the cross but all in all, God is showing the world the beauty of his creation. Sorry for sounding racist. I love football but hate commentators

Consider using Cost of Production in price determination and comparison rather than Per capita income
11/07/2018, 10:02 - Eria Kamya: In your argument, you used the words *affordable* and *cheaper*.  And now you're confusing yourself with the cost of production. In which context and on whose side did you use those words for? From there, we might get to the income per capita thing.
11/07/2018, 10:05 - Eria Kamya: Otherwise I will have to conclude that what you meant was that electricity is still affordable and cheaper to the producers in Uganda than those in other countries 🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂
11/07/2018, 10:06 - Eria Kamya: I mean Cheaper and affordable to produce by the producers
11/07/2018, 10:09 - +256 701 406572: Problem is that it's not fixed. For domestic, it keeps varying. Low at beginning of month only. Yaka technology so good. UMEME making losses in up country coz of power theft. We steal too much. Same with water. People remove water meter at 0600pm, fill 10,000 tank whole night and reconnect meter in morning. I wish NWSC also invests in IT to curb theft. Our prices High coz of wastages to theft. People not poor but bad mannered and in borne to steal anything. Too corrupt yet blame govt which is bad. Feel sorry when they stone chicken thieves to death and leave these middle income earners stealing utilities yet don't pay even taxes collected from rent. It pains me a lot and may God have mercy on us.
11/07/2018, 10:13 - Eria Kamya: Theft of these utilities is everywhere. Not only in Uganda.

11/07/2018, 10:24 - +256 701 406572: Uganda is worse for investors and they put in a lot costly security measures. It's why Ethiopia has cheap per Km road or railway construction. Theft is low. Many houses in Bweyogere came up coz of cheap cement when stadium was built. Bujagali and now Karuma consuming a lot of resources to fight theft.
11/07/2018, 10:33 - +60 16-475 8556: Afande omanyi mi opinion may perhaps be inappropriate but I think and I wish whenever they wud steal cud invest in our country...it wud make sense as pple get jobs there after....and improve their lives and development prevails....but after stealing they bank their money outside Uganda leading to inflation...others contruct mansions outside ...others have big industries and shares in some globe companies....I think pple wud not complain alot since u eat with them...but eating alone is worse especially something thing God given...I mean resources...dont quote me wrongly....

11/07/2018, 11:00 - +60 11-2803 7720: I can conclude that you never understood what I meant. 
But I can elaborate.
While making electricity tariffs, they put in mind the cost of production of electricity. 
So, it’s cheaper to produce Electricity in Uganda because it is HEP.
Other countries that rely more on Coal, Thermal and Geothermal electricity have higher tariffs because its costly to produce. 

So, tariffs for electricity are based more on Cost of production rather than per capita income. 
I hope you get it
So I basically meant that.
11/07/2018, 11:14 - Eria Kamya: Meanwhile I am also yet to conclude that you didn't understand my question. But let me elaborate in this way.  Remember in your statement, you stated that it is cheaper and affordable to produce electricity in Uganda than in the other countries. 

Can you please connect increasing the tarrifs to the low cost of production?
11/07/2018, 11:35 - +60 11-2803 7720: I said so, but I never said the low cost of production doesn’t increase.
11/07/2018, 11:47 - Eria Kamya: You've successfully dodged the question.
11/07/2018, 11:50 - +60 11-2803 7720: I am not ready to reply with an essay on a basic thing. 
If you were keen enough, there was an answer in there. 
You just have to figure it out.
11/07/2018, 12:08 - Eria Kamya: Maybe I am not understanding the basic English. This post came in directed to the picture that I posted. I therefore assumed that you were justifying our increased tariffs with other countries (some of which don't even have dams) where the tarrifs are higher. 

So did you mean that the electricity in Uganda is still affordable and cheaper to *Ugandan consumers*? or you meant to the *electricity producers* in terms of low production costs.

But time is really telling the whole story. Every vice in the government was started by him. Be it corruption, tribalism,etc. That's why I don't blame anyone else apart from him. The rest are just learning from him. Giving mps new cars and security is a way to corrupt and compromise them. That's how corruption started and spread up to the lowest office countrywide. Remember this government replaced Amin's (Tito was so insignificant). By then Uganda was corruption-free.

12/07/2018, 22:04 - +256 701 406572: *MARRIAGE SOFTWARE....*

_I laughed after reading this, think I should share the humour.…_

A young husband wrote this to a *Systems Analyst -*
_(Marriage Software Div);_

*Dear Systems Analyst,*

I am desperate for some help! I recently upgraded my program from *Girlfriend 7.0* to *Wife 1.0* and found that the new program began unexpected _Child Processing_ and also took up a lot of space and valuable resources. This wasn't mentioned in the _product brochure._ 

In addition *Wife 1.0* installs itself into all other programs and launches during systems initialization and then it monitors all other system activities.

Applications such as *"Boys' Night out 2.5"* and *"Golf 5.3"* no longer run, and crashes the system whenever selected.

 Attempting to operate selected *"Soccer 6.3"* always fails and *"Shopping 7.1"* runs instead. 

I cannot seem to keep *Wife 1.0* in the background whilst attempting to run any of my _favorite applications._ Be it online or offline.
 .
I am thinking of going back to *"Girlfriend 7.0"*, but uninstall doesn't work on this program. Can you please help?

_.... The Systems Analyst replied:_

*Dear Customer,*
This is a very common problem resulting from a basic misunderstanding of the functions of the *Wife 1.0 program.* 

Many customers upgrade from _Girlfriend 7.0_ to _Wife 1.0_ thinking that _Wife 1.0_ is merely a *UTILITY AND ENTERTAINMENT PROGRAM.*

 Actually, *Wife 1.0* is an _OPERATING SYSTEM_ designed by its *Creator* to run everything on your current platform.
You are unlikely to be able to purge *Wife 1.0* and still convert back to _Girlfriend 7.0_, as *Wife 1.0* was not designed to do this and it is impossible to _uninstall, delete or purge the program files from the System once it is installed._

Some people have tried to install _Girlfriend 8.0 or Wife 2.0_ but have ended up with even more problems. *_(See Manual under Alimony/Child Support and Solicitors' Fees)._*

Having *Wife 1.0* installed, I recommend you keep it Installed and deal with the difficulties as best as you can. 

When any faults or problems occur, whatever you think has caused them, you must run the.........
*C:\ APOLOGIZE\ FORGIVE ME.EXE* Program and avoid attempting to use the _*Esc-Key_ for it will freeze the entire system.

It may be necessary to run *C:\ APOLOGIZE\ FORGIVE ME.EXE* a number of times, and eventually hope that the operating system will return to normal.

*Wife 1.0,* although a very high maintenance programme, can be very rewarding.

To get the most out of it, consider buying additional Software such as *"Flowers 2.0"* and *"Chocolates 5.0"* or *"HUGS\ KISSES 6.0"* or *"TENDERNESS\ UNDERSTANDING 10.0"* or *"even Eating Out Without the Kids 7.2.1"* _(if Child processing has already started)._

*DO NOT* under any circumstances install *"Secretary 2.1"* _(Short Skirt Version)_ or *"One Nightstand 3.2"* _(Any Mood Version)_, as this is not a supported Application for *Wife 1.0* and the system will almost certainly *CRASH*.

*BEST WISHES!*

Yours,"
Systems Analyst.

15/07/2018, 21:11 - +256 701 406572: Sorry for late reply as I was still glued on TV for our African French team massacring Croatia 4-2. Two Africans of course scored including Mbappe  (youngest player in the tournament). I love French football team but hate their political interventions in Africa.
15/07/2018, 21:16 - Eria Kamya: This is time to celebrate not for that bro. The fact that they've integrated Africans into their team is enough. They believe in us.
15/07/2018, 21:18 - +256 701 406572: Correct. It's what these Englishmen have failed. I wish they also harnessed Nigerian talents as French does with Franchone
15/07/2018, 21:35 - Eria Kamya: But they also tried their best. Me I didn't expect England to reach semi finals. Besides, they also have welbeck, Rushford, young, sterling....
15/07/2018, 21:36 - Eria Kamya: I supported France not only because of Africans in the team, but also because they narrowly missed the Euro to Portugal.
15/07/2018, 22:07 - +256 701 406572: Oh No. It was my worst match of watching football where the best team lost.
15/07/2018, 22:11 - Eria Kamya: That was total luck purposely for ronaldo. The other thing is that whoever goes to the final can do anything.

17/07/2018, 18:34 - +256 701 406572: My OB from Saudi Arabia whom we started together in KL is in London for holidays. He sent his observations on our Alumni group. Kumbe the grass is not greener always on the other side. These so called Developed countries are in crisis and surviving on IT and police to prevent people's revolution.  Uganda is still far better 👇👇
17/07/2018, 18:34 - +256 701 406572: Ok, here is one thing I don't like about London..

Yesterday I met Steve & Sharon.. Two native British homeless couples.. I sat with them and we had a snack I provided..

Steve told me that he has been evicted from his house and he has lived in the streets since.. Then he met Sharon and they are togather for 4 years.. Steve is 31..Sharon is 42.. He tried to get a job but failing to provide a valid address in the job applications eliminated all chances. 

I noticed many many many homeless people are calling the streets home.. And they are young..really young.. and British!! In the other hand.. The luxurious cars are being driven by Chinese and Indians.. Some of them are still speaking English with an accent.. Which can tells you they weren't born and raised in UK.. So for the government allowing foreign money to enter the country and facilitate all processes and procedures for foreigners to live the fancy life they are looking for with the money they brought along .. With absolute ignorance for its own people living in the streets is a real shame..

Roughly speaking, if 5% of all foreign money entering the country is spent on free housing projects the homelessness will disappear in no time.
17/07/2018, 18:49 - +60 16-475 8556: Almost simila in china...in acemics field.Bse of too much competition to join university some Chinese students move abroad since their marks don't reac the target required by govt...but not the same synario to foreigners who are not subjected to such a condition...the pass mark is higher for natives and fair to foreigners imagine...🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂🤣
17/07/2018, 19:48 - +256 701 406572: Terrible. But one lesson I have learnt is that if we stop complaining and work hard even here in Africa, we can have decent living than being on streets of London waiting for govt bailouts. Our nice climate and soils gives us potential
17/07/2018, 19:49 - Eria Kamya: Are you trying to mean that people complain more than they work?
17/07/2018, 19:55 - +256 701 406572: Not all. But always blaming either govt or politicians or their working relatives of not helping enough. Even if you are mere student in Malaysia, some relatives back home may expect something on arrival. I just see pressure on our ladies working as maids in Dubai. Whole clan expects bailout 🙆🙆
17/07/2018, 19:59 - Eria Kamya: Of course you're right. We need to be hardworking in the first place.
18/07/2018, 01:47 - +60 16-475 8556: But nowdays  working hard minus smartness fetches less...I think us we lack the smartness thing coz many ppl work hard my dia but at the end of the month nothing is yielded...hmmm

18/07/2018, 22:31 - +60 16-475 8556: *Joke of the day!* 

_What is the Difference between Wife and Girlfriend?_

Great Thought in *Modified* Version....

*Wife* is like a *TV* and *Girlfriend* is like a *MOBILE.*

At home  you *watch* TV,
but when you go out you *take* your MOBILE.

Sometimes you *enjoy* TV.
But most of the time, you *play* with your MOBILE.

TV is (as good as) *free* for life.
But for the MOBILE, if you don't *pay,* the services will be *terminated.*

TV is *big, bulky* and most of the time *old.*
But the MOBILE is *cute, slim, curvy, replaceable* and *portable.*

Operational costs for TV is often *acceptable.*
But for the MOBILE, it is often *high* and *demanding.*

TV has a *remote.*
But MOBILE *doesn't.*

Most importantly, MOBILE is a *two-way communication* (you talk and listen)
But with the TV, you *MUST only listen* (whether you want to or not)!!!!😝

Last but not least....!
Yet TV s are superior because
TVs don't have *viruses,*
but MOBILEs often *do....!!!!*😂

And mobiles can be easily *hacked* or *stolen.*

*_Take Care._*
Stick to TV only..
_Issued in Public interest!_
😃😂😄

21/07/2018, 14:38 - +60 17-234 7760: Yeah to some extent he is realistic. The mp ran for life but remember he has impunity as a MP. Yet the wanaichi who where with him will tussle it out with the law. 
2nd the mps voted are there cause of being famous or cheap popularity. We need sound minds to bring ideas and solutions on the table. 
I concur with the lunatic this time.
21/07/2018, 14:40 - +60 16-475 8556: He went there yesterday and soon they are gonna be out ...after what will be yo take...thanking him or keeping quiet?
21/07/2018, 14:42 - +60 16-475 8556: No change dat comes smoothly...boss...our grand parents died for this govt to ensure change never think it comes smoothly just like dat.
21/07/2018, 14:42 - Eria Kamya: He simply used wrong statements to bring out the right information. His words were so extreme. However, our mps also need such language for us to restore sanity back into their minds. I remember watching our mps saying, *even us, we didn't understand the mobile money tax. We realised it's impact later.*      This the insanity that has invaded our Parliament. Though he used very bad words, he has some good points regarding the whole situation because I have been following his words from day one. He's simply diverting from his key ideologies to personal attacks.
21/07/2018, 14:44 - +60 16-475 8556: He's just personal dats y I didn't like his comments..
21/07/2018, 14:45 - +60 16-475 8556: Mpz its only Bobi but generised en way politically he's young just looking for platform...
21/07/2018, 14:46 - +60 17-234 7760: True.. somehow i am taking the broad outlook of what he is trying to convey
21/07/2018, 14:47 - +60 16-475 8556: Its there on you tube clear one.
21/07/2018, 14:51 - Eria Kamya: Because one time he said something which I liked. 

He said that Uganda currently needs solutions to the big mess we're in. Therefore, we need solutions to this mess some of which could be raising more money locally (like through taxes). He added that the only issue is that right now Ugandans only need assurance that their taxes will be well managed, which has been lacking over time.
21/07/2018, 14:54 - +60 16-475 8556: And its gonna happen now?? Tolaba nti abeera mu past participle?

21/07/2018, 15:27 - +256 701 406572: I do agree that it became too personal. Maturity in politics brings clash of ideas not personal attacks. But I have liked his courage to defend taxes even if he becomes unpopular to his fans. Uganda needs such principled men who are above cheap popularity to call a spade a spade not big spoon. But current crop of politicians will even fear to tell people in villages to dig pit latrines. Apart from criticising govt policies,  I have never seen valuable input by Hon Bobi Wine on how best our country can be driven into prosperity.
21/07/2018, 15:34 - +60 16-475 8556: Yiiiyi ate afaande oliimbye you ve spoken like an opposition leader hahahah try to check Bobi...have been in Uganda and he was giving out equipments to sm hospitals...man ..cleaning kampala...he sung about obuyonjo before even kwesimbawo....he give expectant mothers necessities what else do u want him to do?...he has educated the youth their own rights....ohhh no afande I know he's yo opponent but maybe tell these pple who left Ug 4yrs back but me maa dia have bn on ground witnessing everything...

21/07/2018, 15:42 - +256 701 406572: You are right that he donates equipt, educates youth, sings, etc. All those were tailored to win him support for MP election. He is smart in area of mobilisation not policy formulation. I only doubted his ideas (ideology) for the country. His principles not his handouts! I read all his letters and his social media pages - 95% criticising with no viable options. Can you send me his ideas on Uganda's foreign policy or how we can achieve vision 2040?

21/07/2018, 15:49 - +256 701 406572: Of course we all know that double taxation retards economic development and is not one of characteristics of good tax policy. We are not arguing about fairness of taxes. We are arguing on character of leaders who can convince people to pay even triple taxation. Leaders who defend even unpopular decisions to cause change whether good or bad. It's what separates Hitler,  Churchill and M7 from average leaders.
21/07/2018, 15:50 - +60 16-475 8556: There many ways of skinning a rat....it depends on how fit you are in a given position...m7 went to bush...demonstration and teaching the youth is what Bobi can do best...its upon us and you to prepare the rat well for a meal...
21/07/2018, 15:53 - +60 16-475 8556: Imagine convincing pple to pay tripple taxation...where do you put the single or doubled taxes before you convince us hmm naye basajja mwe...

21/07/2018, 15:55 - +60 16-475 8556: Maybe he's just lying he won't give them ..or maybe a few and he's just cooling them down...his tricks as usual...hmmm

21/07/2018, 16:40 - +60 11-2803 7720: I actually think you haven’t been following proceedings in the Ugandan Parliament. 
1. Just after his election, he exchange letters with the president advising him on how best the country can be led.
2. He was among the MPs who fought against the tampering of article 102b. Depending on which side you saw it, Hon. Kyagulanyi was fully involved.  
3. He was fully involved and against the motion that voted for both Mobile money taxes on Mobile money and Social media.
4. He has been fully engaged in consulting his constituency about the issues that matter to them and workable solutions on water crisis and feeder roads have been put forward.

Technically, his role as a member of Parliament isn’t to developer the country, but to legislate on issues that make the country. 
I may not be his supporter, but it’s actually erroneous to say he has done nothing! 
I beg to move!
21/07/2018, 16:44 - +60 11-2895 6258: 🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞👏👏👏
21/07/2018, 17:34 - +256 701 406572: You can't measure contribution of a Hon MP as having opposed two bills - age limit and Taxes on MM and SM! He even failed to convince others and the motion was passed not in his favour. He has never authored one or pushed a private bill. Those bills he opposed were cooked by smarter politicians. I mean the ideas were cooked by smarter politicians and his was reactionary (To support or not to support). Many politicians in UK like Wilberforce became popular to oppose slave trade but no credit was given to those who authored slave trade which brought wealth to western nations. I read his letters exchanged with M7 which I based on coz they had no alternative policies. Can you quote one policy he forwarded say to revoulitionarise agriculture sector? Feeder roads in his contingency? Even my LCI tries to mobilise us to force local authorities to work on feeder roads but how do we cover the costs without improving revenue through taxes? He wants services in his constituency on one hand and people not to pay taxes on the other hand? At least Bebe Cool gave good option to balance the budget that govt ought to cut expenditure especially creating new districts.
21/07/2018, 17:38 - +60 11-2803 7720: Afande, you are getting it wrong.
21/07/2018, 17:46 - +60 11-2803 7720: Usually, The key performance indicator  of an MP isn't about the bills they have been able to present on the floor. Actually, in an entire term, there might be only one or two Private members' bills and usually, they are from the majority party members because they need quorum. This isnt about defending govt or not. I am sure deep down your heart, you can see the Impact he has caused. With a majority party in parliament like that we have in Uganda and sleeping back benchers who actually have no contribution for their entire term,  I think its difficult to convince such people to go off script of their party's position. the role of the opposition side to to provide checks and balances to government. actually, Bobiwine and others have done so. they changed the MM tax from 1% to 0.5%. if no one made noise, it would pass.  The speaker has also recalled parliament to reconsider some provisions passed in some bills owing to pressure from Bobiwine and others. I think that contribution is commendable.
21/07/2018, 17:48 - +60 17-234 7760: @256701406572 are u trying to say that MP magyezi is very smart for the private he raised.. ? 😤
21/07/2018, 17:48 - +60 17-234 7760: Private bill

21/07/2018, 17:58 - +60 11-2803 7720: Secondly, the bills he opposed weren't produced by Smart people. They were produced by self-centred maniacs. Imagine, the day they pass MM tax at 1%, the minister of Finance says they passed the wrong thing. imagine a self-centred maniac putting the wrong weight of citizens of his country because he wants to appease. I also don't think Magyezi's bill was popular. He presented a bill authored by self-centred maniacs at the cost of the citizens. they spent over 2 billions bribing Mps from their own party, raiding parliament with the army and all the illegalities. See, what happened after these wise bills, the state and parliament were dragged to court! imagine such very "wise" people????? plus, look at garbage Bebe cool is saying!! i am actually wondering you are supporting such
21/07/2018, 18:02 - +60 16-475 8556: Am also scared man maybe he's saying something new to them...whatever he said Hon.Lutamaguzi and Tamale Mirundi said it already...even us with sm small brain we can reason it minus listening first to those pple.

21/07/2018, 18:15 - +256 701 406572: You are right my bro. It's very easy to criticise govt policies when in opposition to win popularity especially in LDCs than when in ruling govt to defend them. NRM MPs discuss extensively in the caucus and once the decision is taken, there is what they call collective ownership and responsibility. It's what happens in military institutions too. Even nursery kid can know which teacher is best or strict and critic them. There is no innovation,  genius or creativity in just criticing other policies. What I need to see is alternative policies only
21/07/2018, 18:18 - +60 11-2803 7720: I support my government and I actually love my country. But the state of affairs currently are gross and actually, indefensible. There is no way I can support Mobile money tax and Social media Tax. I mean, the Tax base is largely huge but left out. Imagine if each and every Acre of land in Uganda was taxed Ugx 1000. that would be a better source of tax. Most countries pay Land tax, but because the policy makers own thousands of acres, they are exempting themselves from the tax and expecting it from the poor people.  The whole thing is being driven by self-centred guys.
21/07/2018, 18:19 - +60 16-475 8556: Policy without finance..power and any institution providing a backbone? How will policies function...just give him power and we show you that science..Education and iT can change Uganda....

21/07/2018, 18:22 - +60 11-2803 7720: unfortunately, in Uganda, Planning is top-bottom rather with bottom up. They never consider the views of the people. The policy framework in Uganda is wrong.  Secondly, just out of curiosity, would you enlighten men with when Museveni has ever gotten advice from anyone, ok, to simplify it, from opposition! Even when he has been advised in parliament and other channels?
21/07/2018, 18:26 - +60 16-475 8556: Maybe he gets advise from Besigye when we are in bed who knows and they dangle us like chocolate in mouth.
21/07/2018, 18:28 - +60 11-2803 7720: My brother, With the mistakes he started to make over the last decade, i strongly doubt he picks any advice from anyone.
21/07/2018, 18:29 - +60 16-475 8556: Cos he's panicking now?
21/07/2018, 18:30 - +60 16-475 8556: Firstly he doesn't trust anyone as they don't trust him too...thats the challenge...
21/07/2018, 18:32 - +60 11-2803 7720: Enough Politics for today. After sending my mother Mobile money, ask me how it feels to pay the "wrong" tax. Good night guys

21/07/2018, 19:50 - +256 701 406572: These are facts. In Post independence Africa,  power was in hands of the military who could kick Heads of State anytime in military coups. Mabutu, Amin, etc came to power through that gate. Army Chiefs were all powerful. That era is gone. Currently, African nations have copied western democracy of rule of law. Use law to achieve your goals. Use law not army to dictate policies. This puts MPs and Courts important than military. The Speaker and Chief Justice become semi-gods replacing military chiefs. Kenya and Maldives saw few men dressed as Judges overturn decision of millions of voters. Even Uhuru realised late that power is no longer in Police or Army Chiefs but Parliament and Courts. In Zimbabwe, Military just provided environment for those two arms to shape the destiny of the country. The new Italian govt has used law to refuse illegal immigrants. See how Singapore uses the laws to devt. So Mr. Kamya if you become president of Uganda, use all methods to win MPs to pass laws to propell your vision and courts to punish or reward those who support or oppose. Many Muslim nations have discovered that Western democracy  (laws dictate everything) is not suitable. Amagye gaffe is no longer option.  Otherwise thanks for nice debate comrades and we meet tomorrow as my OTT is about to expire 😂😂

That's why our president is nolonger advisable because he has personalised the country's vision, thus making himself the sole policy maker. In that sense, he believes that he's the only one with a vision not only in NRM but in the whole country.

*Eating Fruit on Empty Stomach*

This will open your eyes ! Read to the end; and then, send it to others on your list as I just did to u!

Dr Stephen Mak treats terminal ill cancer patients by an "un-orthodox" way and many patients recovered.

Before he used solar energy to clear the illnesses of his patients, he believes on natural healing in the body against illnesses. See his article below.

It is one of the strategies to heal cancer. As of late, my success rate in curing cancer is about 80%.

Cancer patients shouldn't die. The cure for cancer is already found - *its in the way we eat fruits.*

It is whether you believe it or not.

I am sorry for the hundreds of cancer patients who die under the conventional treatments.

*EATING FRUIT*

We all think eating fruits means just buying fruits, cutting it and just popping it into our mouths.

It's not as easy as you think. It's important to know how and *when* to eat the fruits.

What is the correct way of eating fruits?

*IT MEANS NOT EATING FRUITS AFTER YOUR MEALS!*
5
*FRUITS SHOULD BE EATEN ON AN EMPTY STOMACH*

If you eat fruits on empty stomach, it will play a major role to detoxify your system, supplying you with a great deal of energy for weight loss and other life activities. 

_FRUIT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOOD._

Let's say you eat two slices of bread and then a slice of fruit.

The slice of fruit is ready to go straight through the stomach into the intestines, but it is prevented from doing so due to the bread taken before the fruit.

In the meantime the whole meal of bread & fruit rots and ferments and turns to acid. 

The minute the fruit comes into contact with the food in the stomach and digestive juices, the entire mass of food begins to spoil.

So please eat your fruits on an *empty stomach* *or before your meals !*

You have heard people complaining : 

Every time I eat watermelon I burp, when I eat durian my stomach bloats up, when I eat a banana I feel like running to the toilet, etc.. etc..

Actually all this will not arise if you eat the fruit on _an empty stomach._

The fruit mixes with the putrefying of other food and produces gas and hence you will bloat !

Greying hair, balding, nervous outburst and dark circles under the eyes all these will *NOT* *happen if you take fruits on an empty stomach.*

There is no such thing as some fruits, like orange and lemon are acidic, because all fruits become alkaline in our body, according to Dr. Herbert Shelton who did research on this matter. 

If you have mastered the correct way of eating fruits, you have the  *SECRET of beauty, longevity, health, energy, happiness and normal weight.*

When you need to drink fruit juice - *drink only  fresh fruit juice,* NOT from the cans, packs or bottles.

Don't even drink juice that has been heated up. 

Don't eat cooked fruits because you don't get the nutrients at all. 

You only get its taste.
Cooking destroys all the vitamins.

But eating a whole fruit is better than drinking the juice.

If you should drink the fresh fruit juice, drink it mouthful by mouthful slowly, because you must let it mix with your saliva before swallowing it. 

You can go on a 3-day fruit fast to cleanse or detoxify your body. 

Just eat fruits and drink fresh fruit juice throughout the 3 days.

And you will be surprised when your friends tell you how radiant you look !

*KIWI fruit:*
Tiny but mighty. 
This is a good source of potassium, magnesium, vitamin E & fiber. Its vitamin C content is twice that of an orange.

*APPLE:*
An apple a day keeps the doctor away? 
Although an apple has a low vitamin C content, it has antioxidants & flavonoids which enhances the activity of vitamin C thereby _helping to lower the risks of colon cancer, heart attack & stroke._ 

*STRAWBERRY:*
Protective Fruit. 
Strawberries have the highest total antioxidant power among major fruits & protect the body from cancer-causing, blood vessel-clogging and free radicals. 

*ORANGE :*
Sweetest medicine. 
Taking 2-4 oranges a day may _help keep colds away, lower cholesterol, prevent & dissolve kidney stones as well as lessens the risk of colon cancer._

*WATERMELON:*
Coolest thirst quencher. Composed of 92% water, it is also packed with a giant dose of glutathione, which _helps boost our immune system._

They are also *a key source of lycopene the cancer fighting oxidant.*
Other nutrients found in watermelon are vitamin C & Potassium. 

*GUAVA & PAPAYA:*
Top awards for vitamin C. They are the clear winners for their high vitamin C content.

Guava is also rich in fiber, which _helps prevent constipation._

Papaya is rich in carotene; this is _good for your eyes._

*Drinking COLD water or drinks after a meal = CANCER*

Can you believe this ?

For those who like to drink cold water or cold drinks, this article is applicable to you. 

It is nice to have a cup of cold water or cold drinks after a meal.

*However, the cold water or drinks will solidify the oily stuff that you have just eaten.*

*It will slow down the digestion.*

*Once this 'sludge' reacts with the acid, it will break down and be absorbed by the intestine faster than the solid food.*

*It will line the intestine.*

*Very soon, this will turn into FATS and lead to CANCER !*

_*It is best to drink hot soup or warm water after a meal.*_

Let's be careful and be aware. The more we know the better chance we could survive.

A cardiologist says: 
if everyone who gets this mail sends it to 10 people, you can be sure that we'll save at least one life.

So lets do it

22/07/2018, 12:17 - Eria Kamya: Good article!!! 

However, one problem still to be addressed especially in African countries is about the fruit chemicals. For example, The pre-harvest interval in African countries is not taken seriously by many African farmers. This instead increases the cancer risks to the fruit lovers.

I think more research is indeed needed to reduce the amount of chemicals applied on fruits and vegetables. Otherwise, the benefits of fruits in curbing cancer could instead turn into causes of cancer.

26/07/2018, 03:19 - +60 12-380 9334: MY PROBLEM WITH THE DEGREE. MY ENCOUNTER WITH GRADUATES/UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. 

By Henry Mutebe

Yesterday, a friend called to check on me. It had been long since we talked. He asked if I had sometime so I could roll over and check on him. I was happy to go check on him. After we had finished University, he had started a small restaurant in town. It has grown exponentially over the years. When I arrived at the restaurant, I was very impressed by how many leaps he had made, in what I believe to be a short time for a business like his. We shuffled through the memories and had a hearty laugh. 

As hours went by, I noticed that when customers entered and took seats, he was attending to them and doing a lot of the serving. I asked him if he didn’t have enough staff. He told me that one of the girls working at the restaurant was sick while another guy simply didn’t show up or call to let him know…so he was short of labour. I asked if I can help. He joked, ‘Henry you know I can’t afford you. Here I pay 10,000shs to the attendants. How will I manage to pay you?'  I told him am happy to work. 

I quickly oriented myself on the etiquette and customer care rules …and most importantly what was available. So we started serving people that came in. In total, I served about 8 clients before something interesting happened. 

As we talked and laughed about the crazy things we did in school, two students I taught at University (a gentleman and lady) came by. They did not immediately notice I was the one but their eyes kept preying on me to confirm they were seeing the ‘real person.’

To confirm their disbelief, I asked my friend to let me serve them. So I went over, humbled myself, bent slightly, greeted them and asked to take their orders. They were very surprised and asked me, ‘What are you doing here sir?’ I told them that am there to serve them.  They looked at each other and with the face of mixed feelings wondered why I would be working in a restaurant. 

The girl asked, ‘Sir, but why are you working here? You can’t serve us. I mean…?’ she nodded her head in disbelief before continuing, ‘…you can’t work in a restaurant?’. I told them I would serve them and am happy to take their orders. You could easily notice that they were very surprised and reserved about placing their orders. 

They had mixed feelings about my presence there and the type of work I was doing.  After a very interesting exchange, they finally made their order which I delivered promptly. They had their delicious meal as we also continued conversing and reminiscing the years gone by. From time to time, I kept checking on them and asked if they needed anything else. When they were done, my friend punched in the bill, printed the receipt and I delivered it to them. 

Their bill was 24,500shs. I placed it on the table and took the plates away. The guy placed two notes (a 20k and 10k shs) on the table and they left. I delivered it to my friend, who was now serving as manager, cashier and sometimes a waiter. He gave me back the change of 5,500shs which I happily slipped into my wallet.  By the way ...by this time, I had 15,000shs in tips from the other 8 clients I had served. So by adding this 5500shs, I was 20,500shs rich already.
 
As the couple (my former students) went out, they each looked back in disbelief. I looked at them and raised my hand to say bye. They walked into the street and faded away into the bright light from approaching cars. A couple of other clients came in and I served them. My friend was very pleased and paid my 10000shs and a bonus of 2000shs which he says he offers once a waiter exceeds a certain number of clients.  At 11pm, I left the restaurant and went home. 

As I sat in the car to head back home, I couldn’t help thinking about my students. Their disbelief was innocent…but it speaks a lot about a general problem we have in our society. These two students represent thousands of others. They me made think, very deeply, about our Ugandan graduates. I do not blame them, its a general problem.

 I have had the opportunity to travel and study from elsewhere or in other cultures and I have always been surprised by how people in other countries don’t despise jobs. My good students could not imagine their lecturer serving them in a restaurant. Since they know my work and qualifications, they could not understand how I can be in a restaurant at this time. As if it takes away my degree or other job. It gave me a lot of thoughts about our graduates. The more I have travelled, the more I have learned and unlearned. 

In 2012, while at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in England, one of my classmates used to drive a BMW, park it at a restaurant and work as a waiter. He came from a very wealthy family but he still worked. He told me that as soon as he completed high school, he had to take part time jobs to earn some money to pay rent to his father and contribute to household bills. It shocked me quite a lot considering what I have grown up seeing in my part of the world. 

As if this was not enough, I also found out that, when students finish high school in these countries, as must, they have to find some work and either rent out, or pay their parents some money for rent if they are to continue staying in their parent’s house.  I was shocked by the idea of a son paying rent to his father. It took time to sink in. The more I interacted with more of these people, the more I realised that this is a common culture. They teach a child responsibility from a very early age. Work is not for money per se, it is a service.

The lesson I learnt from them is that working is a value. One has to work and parents teach their children that they have to work and earn. Just because your parents are wealthy doesn’t mean your life is already worked out. You have to contribute to the home bills and somehow find something to do. The work doesn’t have to be white colour…but as a must, you have to find something to put your hands to. You cant seat your bums and just wait for a white collar job.

When I went to Norway, I found the same story. Most university students, unless they simply can’t find time due to course overload, have to have some form of temporary work. Students often work as attendants, waiters in restaurants, cleaners in hotels, shop attendants, drivers, newspaper vendors, et cetera. It is a value to work and few people dont despise jobs. 

By the way, they don’t work because their parents can’t give them money. They work because it is a value that has been embedded in them from childhood. Once a student finishes high school, they take on a part time job and save money for use at university or travels. Few parents will buy their child a ticket to come to Africa to tour. You have to work and save for your luxuries.  

If you want some money from your parents, you borrow and pay back. Nothing comes free. They teach you to live on your own. Being at University or having a degree is ‘nothing.’ You are not the first or the last. Serving people in a restaurant does not make anyone look less a graduate. Service is service! Work is a value. 

As a matter of fact, most of the places near Universities are filled with university students working as part timers. University students are encouraged to take up these part time jobs. The white people we like to imitate are doing what we think is too dirty or casual for a graduate in Africa. 

It got me thinking about students in our Universities here in Uganda. I thought about all the restaurants around Wandegeya, Banda –Kyambogo, MUBS, and the attitude of University students and graduates about these type of jobs. I thought about the poor attitude we have towards work. I looked at the chapatti boys and girls we despise who are minting money and doing great things in their lives and for their families. I thought about the people who fear nothing, who go out and just do it while we sit back.

The more I thought about it the more I realised why we are going to take longer to develop. We have a generation of young people who feel they are too educated to do certain jobs. We have a generation of children who have been prepared for a life that doesn’t exist. We have a crop of young people who are whiter than the whites. My time in Europe taught me that we need to get back on the drawing board and re-orient our graduates. 

Students in our universities should be oriented to appreciate the value of work. There is no reason why a University should not employ students to clean the Library, kitchen, dining halls, hostels. It is improper that a university canteen should find external staff when it has over 30,000 students who can work in shifts and serve other students. 

See, through this kind of work, being able to do ordinary jobs and be seen as a servant makes you true leaders. When students grow up with a sense of entitlement and a higher standard of living, it translates into greed when they get into national politics. They apportion themselves good things, higher privileges and want to float above everyone because work is about money, status and not service. Such humble work makes true leaders. 

People who are willing to serve, and not merely earn make better leaders. Such work raises a generation of leaders who don’t do things to be seen or be thought of as higher and more qualified, but leaders who get things done. In some firms in western societies, when they look at a CV, such experience, demonstrates the attitude of a person, their humility, values and philosophy towards work.  

We are raising a generation of children whose only image of the west is what they watch on TV. They speak using enhanced accents, know what is the latest, they are ‘cool’ but they have no idea what makes the west what it is. My experience in the west shows me something different. People work and do ordinary jobs and that’s how things get done. 

If we are to get good leaders, we must first change the attitude of young people about work. An inflated self-image creates bad leaders who want to further segregate themselves from the ordinary people they consider low and less qualified. We have a big problem in our society and we have to find a way to deal with it. 

Students despise these jobs because they believe work is about status and money. Taken further into their lives, it means they may likely want to maintain status and money as their pursuits when they get into leadership positions. If we must correct our leadership and governance problems, we may also need to do something about the attitude of students and graduates about their philosophies and values about work. In there, lies a very big problem. 

Do not despise work, go out there and just work. The pope was once a bouncer at a club. Today he is one of the most powerful men in the world. Imagine that you had nothing to fear, what would you do to earn a living? Imagine that you had no degree or that anyone cares, what would you do to earn a living? Imagine, that no one is going to help you find a job, what would do? 

I am not saying go do what you dont like...but may be...just may be you may need to develop a new attitude towards work, serve people (in whatever opportunities unfold) and be happy to have served. You can never tell what the future holds, and you may never know who you will meet at your humble place of work. Most interestingly, you may never know the untold story of those who work and serve you in those places where you go as the bosses or the rich. 

Even for you that are already employed in 'high' places, don’t mind going out and just find a part time job (if you have time) or offer services in the evening or weekend at any place where your services can be of use. Meet people, network and just keep yourself active. Degrees are everywhere...literally every one has them...so just forget about the whole hype about it and be true to yourself. As you look for other opportunities...dont be afraid to branch off a little and keep yourself at something. Don’t despise jobs. Serve. I am now looking for my next gig. I am happy to serve. So you restaurant/hotel people...dont fear to holla at me...If I have time...I will come and serve with a smile. :) :) Cheers
26/07/2018, 06:25 - Eria Kamya: I like this article. Our society really needs to be re-oriented. 

However, I don't blame this society. It will just take us some time to get back to our original values. Originally as Africans, work or service was much of a value. It was a responsibility right from childhood. However when the colonialists came, they taught us otherwise. Here, we either didn't understand them, or it simply became misconception in these ways;

Parents started thinking that their children should only substitute the value of work with the education value. Up to now, a parent is not willing to let his child start working part time. This they know that once a child starts working and register any form of early success, education will no longer have value to them. This I don't blame them because I have also seen such children get excited about the early success of work, forgetting that everything thing has a long run situation. And also from my experience, most of the people (basically school dropouts) that started work with early success suffered the long run situation. 

Therefore, parents will not let a child start working during the early ages. They're not willing to put up with the stubbornness that comes with it. This has actually killed so many passions. Eventually, the children will start working after graduation. Now at this stage, their instincts dictate that they should value the time spent in education thus ignoring the simple jobs. 

I have happened to live a multi-situational life, and have many examples of these situations. But before I think of the government, both the parents and children have to change not only their attitudes to work and service but also their understanding of the value of work and education.

If I had the power to, I would have suggested that during every year at law school, students should be taught something to do with just this ruling. 
course units like Ethics and Law,  professional code of conduct, and two more others should be created just to reflect on Justice Kenneth Kakuru’s ruling. 

Also, every student should be taught a course on patriotism and Ugandan history just to make them aware that the everything rotated around history

28/07/2018, 05:30 - +60 11-6111 5832: The influence of Bobi wine is evident 
According to speech of highest honour of the country he will frustrate the efforts of opposition
28/07/2018, 05:32 - +60 11-6111 5832: I imagine him and his resources failing terribly 😫😫at just a certain constituency
28/07/2018, 06:25 - +60 16-475 8556: That's normal in politics...but at least he's responsible for some revolution going on now...opposition was practical but on M7z tune...but at least they are waking up and if they depart from Besigye whoz co.NRM then our future could be bright...Kyagulanyi has inspired many youth and this is evident every where...I think it will be hotter in 2021...

Moral of the story: Never underestimate a success. As little as it can be, it can be the long awaited spark plug
28/07/2018, 09:45 - +256 701 406572: Let us look examples from other countries to draw conclusions including our own history. Are you predicting that in 2021, Wine will defeat established parties like NRM and Opposition parties?
28/07/2018, 09:47 - +60 11-2803 7720: Emmanuel Macron, didn’t have a party. 
In 6 months to elections, he formed a non-Leftists and also a non- right wing party. 
By preaching neutrality, Macron is the President of France.
28/07/2018, 09:48 - +60 11-2803 7720: So, never underestimate any effort.
28/07/2018, 09:49 - +256 701 406572: You are 100% correct. Another example in Sub Saharan Africa or LDC
28/07/2018, 09:51 - +60 16-475 8556: Mr 🤣🤣 of course you know better then y should we site out examples for you may be ur trying to divert us..🤣🤣🤣
28/07/2018, 09:55 - +60 16-475 8556: Even if Bobi doesn't take presidency which I know is hard especially for bushmen to withdraw nevertheless he has opened up many Ugandans brains and eyes...atleast a non educated peasant can eat yo bribe and vote substance as it happened in Bugiri...dats a success...✌🏿
28/07/2018, 09:56 - +256 701 406572: Basalirwa was strong and popular and opinion polls before elections put him a head. But in Politics, sometimes parties just want to show loyalty to their own candidates even if they know won't go through. It's aimed at building party cohesion and pick lessons to prepare well in next elections. Bobi is just after popularity going with strong popular independent candidate. I liked how NRM showed loyalty and party unite to their own and will come strong in next elections.
28/07/2018, 09:56 - +60 11-2803 7720: President Ameenah Gurib-Fakim. 
Just a few months after resigning as a university Professor, she became president of Mauritius.
28/07/2018, 10:00 - +256 701 406572: It's okay if you can meander from France to Mauritius or any other French dominated Island. Good thing you have got my point and I have many examples to support other theory
28/07/2018, 10:04 - +60 16-475 8556: No FDC and NRM are one compound...if you watch or listen to news one FDC prominent guy said if it's not FDC then should be NRM what's that...u pple yo hypocrets...the guy has been with you all along...in Besigyes games with police...trying to defend hypocrets in court....we know whatever yo doing...but judgement is soon...
28/07/2018, 10:06 - +60 16-475 8556: Basalirwa alone could not make it...don't underrate other pples contribution....why did m7 go support his member if they are strong with all the necessities resources and even electro commission and bribery?
28/07/2018, 10:07 - +60 16-475 8556: You saw very well what happened in Jinja still Bobiz influence and the rest was there.
28/07/2018, 10:08 - +60 11-2803 7720: There is something I want you to know. 
Yesterday, there were like 5 by-elections.
Nebbi NRM
Apac  *UPC*
Kotido *NRM*
Ibanda *NRM*
Sheema *NRM*
But all of these were irrelevant. They gave NRM the numbers they wanted but compared to the importance of Bugiri and the circumstances surrounding it, NRM lost the weekend to Bobi Wine. 
Mind you, Bugiri is a rural constituency which NRM boost to take. 
Just a few weeks earlier, the odds were against Asuman and his little known Party Jeema. 
After Day one of Bobi wine’s appearance in Bugiri, the tables turned in favour of Asuman. 

So, that is the influence we also witnessed in Rukungiri and soon, he will be oriented. 

Hey, Mahatir also had no well established party till election the 2018 polls in Malaysia but he is Prime minister. 
Have you ever heard about Coalitions? They do work
28/07/2018, 10:09 - +60 16-475 8556: U know how nrm pours cash into staff and even th no. Of ballots where nrm won was bigger than the no.of voters in jinja but still you were beaten and yo still under rating some one wait...the day it happens in yo municipality or constituency...I think thats when you will comprehend
28/07/2018, 10:10 - +60 16-475 8556: 👆🏿
28/07/2018, 10:14 - +256 701 406572: Dr Mahatir was Malaysia longest serving PM and brought economic success and it's the reason opposition parties chose him despite advanced age to wrestle power from Najib.
28/07/2018, 10:17 - +60 11-2803 7720: What’s makes you believe that Ugandans can’t trust Boni wine as the much thought of power to cause change? 
By winning in Bugiri, despite the hurdles and stambling blocks the state set infront of him, he is showing his ability to foster the lead in change!
28/07/2018, 10:18 - +60 16-475 8556: Thats y he said coalition govts show results...who knows what may happen towards 2021...just know many changes and politics gonna happen...🤷🏿‍♂
28/07/2018, 12:04 - +256 701 406572: I am not diverting you but in political science,  we are governed by real tested theories. In this case, theories governing democratic governance and transition. Theory one states that a popular leader can take advantage of people's frustrations and wrestle power from established parties. This is theory you are pushing that Bobi can beat all Ugnada's established parties like what Macron did in France. Unfortunately, this theory has never succeeded in Sub Saharan Africa and Latin America.
28/07/2018, 12:05 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣
28/07/2018, 12:14 - +60 16-475 8556: So u mean we resort to the theory that M7 used..?it's also very possible...only that we are in internet error...unless we are fighting external powers but just know everything is possible in politics...no permanence...m7 theory took long just like opposition struggle has been in the struggle...but lem assure you that you can never be smart all times...one simple or small mistake or miscalculation will put you down and u will always be history to Uganda...yo small gods are never loyal... and by the way whom do you serve?...

28/07/2018, 12:52 - +256 701 406572: That's not what i meant. Armed struggle is not part of democratic transition of power. Africa's governance and transition is in three broader categories - ABC. In Category A, there has been change of power between parties and security forces protect any party which assumes leadership. Best example of these countries is Ghana. Rawlings party was defeated and then came back. It's like US Republicans and Democrats or UK conservative and Labour party.
28/07/2018, 12:55 - +256 701 406572: Category B is only one party has been ruling for long but keeps changing it's leaders. It has strong internal transitional mechanism and in Africa,  we have CCM of Tanzania, ANC of S.Africa, Ethiopia, and many others. Outside Africa,  China, Vietnam falls in B category.
28/07/2018, 13:00 - +60 16-475 8556: UK and USA should be out...of this coz there there's no democracy...by the time one becomes president...he's already prepared and directed on what to do and not...by bankers and secret societies...that's y Trump is in scandals coz they had voted for Hillary...if it wasn't for Russia to rig for trump.
28/07/2018, 13:03 - +60 16-475 8556: And apparently where do we fall 33 yrs by one party by one person yt all these yrs we would be having like like 3 to 4 presidents...meaning you can not rule out the bush theory if it doesn't happen like for Mugabe...
28/07/2018, 13:04 - +60 16-475 8556: 3to4 Former presidents
28/07/2018, 13:05 - +256 701 406572: I won't go to category C. So in democratic transition, countries move from category C to B and then to A. In A, all structures are in place and a leader just implementes. No country in Africa and Latin America has jumped from C to A. It's what brought chaos in Somalia, CAR, Sudan. Zimbabwe is now in category B. Democracy is progressive my brother
28/07/2018, 13:06 - +60 16-475 8556: As for the current situation ..its like if M7 ends.. NRM and Uganda will end too.which is....hmm
28/07/2018, 13:11 - +60 16-475 8556: And remember our democracy Uganda in particular is so young where by yo guy is democratic if the issue raised doesn't attach to  his power of agendas...u saw what happened with togikwatako....mps lost the case but him remained god untouchable no debating  aboutit ...for those who fought his agenda u knw wht he did to them in parliament..u know what happened verywell...so no much democracy ur advertising...
28/07/2018, 13:12 - +60 11-2803 7720: C-A 
Change in power between parties in Africa.

 - Kenya’s situation when Uhuru was voted for the first term? 
- Gambia when Yahya Jammeh the incumbent president lost? 

- in Malawi when Joyce Banda lost the presidency
28/07/2018, 13:15 - +256 701 406572: Neither Kenya nor Gambia nor Malawi was in Category C my brother Daaki. Anyway,  can we discuss economy
28/07/2018, 13:17 - +60 16-475 8556: IMAGINE AN ARMY MAN BEING PARTISAN AND IS ADVERTISING DEMOCRACY...YET YOU ONLY WORK IN FAVOUR OF YO GUY NOT THE COUNTRY...UR BETRAYING YO COUNTRY TOO...YOU HAVE TO BE TAKEN TO COURT hehehe....u pple you think we don't understand what yo doing...all the effort u put in just to retain power for someone who even doesn't pay you salary for months....are you slaves..? Do you have freedom?..how can you serve one who does not pay if you don't pay yo self through other means?
28/07/2018, 13:20 - +60 11-2803 7720: Dear Mr. Kalungi, refrain from using a very harsh tone directed to a fellow group member.

28/07/2018, 13:30 - +256 701 406572: I have seen suffering my brother in South Sudan,  CAR and Somalia and it shaped my thinking. I have read and heard testimonies how past armies were tribalistic and killed innocent civilians and themselves. I grew in era where for us in Eastern, we were exporting our beautiful girls as maids to Kenya. Nairobi was like Dubai now and these ladies used to come with just sugar and bread in Xmas and we lined for it. But currently,  we are respected internationally despite few challenges my bro. Kenyans filling our schools and colleges. We shall know how good Mzee is when he is gone. Only few of us want to thank him when he is still around. With peace, hard working Ugandans can leave poverty. In Jinja were I stay, each day, UMEME receives on average 200 new applicants for Yaka! The houses coming up just gives me hope. I will defend anyone people of Uganda chose and now it's still Mzee term. Hope your tone of language was jokes not real my bro.
28/07/2018, 13:30 - +60 11-2803 7720: Yes I understand and I am an advocate of free speech. 
I however understand the importance of having a balance discussion without having to use strong and language that may in some way be deemed insulting.
Lastly, We should have respect for each other. 
In good faith, let’s refrain from direct attacks.
28/07/2018, 13:32 - +60 11-2895 6258: how does she behave?
28/07/2018, 13:40 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣 so we have improved by exporting gals to overseas 😂 and also Kenyans filling our schools. Even Malaysia will start bragging about Chinese filling their schools, yet they're fleeing tougher academics from China.  🤣🤣🤣
28/07/2018, 13:41 - +60 16-475 8556: Actually me I just feel bad for you guys...I wanted to join Ugandan army coz I was inspired by my uncle and have tried to live such kind of life but when I got in touch with some guys in their....I lost love due to what i was told and witnessed... wanted to join outside powers that respect a life of a soldier....our boys loose their  lives in Somalia and Sudan not for my country but for one person which you know verywell...since other powers like Kenya benefit from the infrastructures they constructed as for us its these temporary markets yt we r the fighters and our tax...
28/07/2018, 13:45 - +60 16-475 8556: So many things have changed not because of mzee...its because they have to...like u go to sch...and get knowledge and change yo life and families...is it mzee who changed ur life....even at Aminz time we had scholars who are still present...smtyms pple change even if govt fails to change dats y we are changing...not bse of mzee...in life as you encounter different situations you change spiritually physically mentally and financially...
28/07/2018, 13:56 - +60 16-475 8556: Man don't laugh this makes me feel like shading tears cos many gals and boys have lost their womanhood and manhood from those countries...they only go there expecting gd change in their lives...others even die in the process but our govt most times care less...man only that here sm of us  are blessed...but man a woman leaves her country.her kids to travel and work as a "......." worker imagine coz no opportunity at home where we praise for gd change...done by govt...pains but nothing to do...so don't laugh✌🏿
28/07/2018, 13:58 - +60 16-475 8556: She's good only that she is used by mafias for their own good and she also agrees coz she gains smthing...dats y....
28/07/2018, 14:01 - +256 701 406572: You can't understand it my bro. In 80s, a Ugandan maid in Nairobi could save full year and comes home for Xmas with only bread, sugar and gomasi. Current maids in Middle East are building rentals, paying university fees for relatives! Of course it's better to export your labour to developed countries than neibours 😂😂😂

31/07/2018, 08:20 - +256 701 406572: An engineer designs a world class car. The CEO is impressed with the outcome and praised him a lot. While trying to bring out the car from the manufacturing area to the showroom, they realised that the car is 2 inches taller than the entrance

The CEO was confused on how to take it outside of the manufacturing area.

The painter said that they can bring out the car and there will be a few scratches on top of the car which could be touched up later 

The engineer said that they can break the entrance, take the car out, and later re-do it.

The CEO was not convinced with any of them. 

A Watchman was observing all the drama & slowly approached the CEO. He wanted to give an idea if they had no problem

The watchman said, The car is only a few inches taller than the entrance so, simply release the air in the tyre, the height of the car will sink and can be easily taken out

Don't analyse the problems only from an expert point of view alone. There is always a layman's outlook that gives an alternate solution at a given point in time

Life issues are also the same
Release Some Air. It could be our anger, ego and or Our confusion.
In the end it's all about Adjusting the height (Attitude), to make things easier and less complicated. Release some air.

You apply for a visa to travel to this particular country, this visa is given to you, you finally and happily travel , reach there airport they go a head to allow you proceed and enter there country (China), however after you arrive at your hotel you are bounced. Receptionists tell you how they can’t check you into there hotel particularly if you are holding Ugandan and Nigerian passport respectively. These are the orders that police have given to everyone running a hotel here in guangyuan xilu part of Guangzhou, and should you fail to comply then you risk closure. Indeed a couple of hotels have been closed.

And for restaurants almost all that were selling African foods were closed whether owned by Africans or Chinese.
To make matters worse even those that serve Chinese foods are not willing to serve Africans,
Myself I was denied service at this particular Chinese restaurant where i had be a frequent client each time am here. I had to walk around look for some other place to have a meal. So you find yourself in a situation where you have neither where to sleep nor where to eat. The police ask you to move some miles away from this market center in order to book a hotel,it’s quite terrible.

But one would ask why particularly target Ugandan and Nigerian passport holders??
Information from the Chinese authorities indicate that a number of Nigerian Nationals who have been arrested in the act of Drug trafficking are holding Ugandan passports. So they say it’s now difficult for them to tell whether those holding Ugandan passports are truly Ugandans or Nigerians but masquerading as Ugandans.
This is what is happening here in guangyuan xilu part of Guangzhou.

Imagine we have officials of ministry of internal affairs who are busy minting money by selling passports to criminals and drug traffickers. And Because of them its becoming very difficult for some of us who come here for business to survive. In fact these Chinese have already black listed us Ugandans just because some money hungry individuals at the passport office are busy selling passports.

04/08/2018, 10:31 - +60 12-380 9334: GUYS, YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS:
A Ugandan graduate, Abbey Semuwemba, will get another job and they will give him shs.1, 600,000 if he has more than 3 years of experience. Three months into the new job he will buy a car. He will wake up at 5/6am and get home after 6/7pm every day. He will see nothing wrong with this because "he is educated" and that's how "educated people" do it. His street smart friends who have flexible careers will visit him at work because if it’s not yet 5pm he isn’t allowed leaving, even when there's no work. He will be focused on his career and he will not want to hear anything about starting a side hustle because "he is educated". His excuses will be "I don't know how to sell" or "I don't have time". 

At that time he is struggling financially. Debit orders are busy with his salary. He won't see a side hustle as a way out, he will see another job as a way out. Companies will take advantage of him, overwork him and underpay him because he is not street smart to beat them at their own game. He will work for horrible bosses who don’t understand the importance of family time and he will always be forced to choose work over his loved ones. He will win employee of the month left, right and centre and he will get stupid vouchers as a reward. Like most graduates, he will go back to school and study ENDLESSLY, this course and that course all in the name of "I want a better life" and chase promotions at work. He will get his 5 years/ 10 years certificate of service with shs.1m/ shs.2m incentive that will only get him a weekend in Kampala, a city where you even pay tax for being on social media.

He will buy a house on mortgage in his 30's just after paying off his car and commit himself to a 20-year debt. And he will not want a house in the township or a starter pack house that he can actually afford to pay faster. He will go straight to the rich "burbs" because "he is educated". He will feel the punch of rates and taxes and learn a new bad habit of buying grocery, petrol and data with a credit card. After paying off this ONE house for 20 years, he will be in his 50's.

At 55 he will retire. First thing he will do with his retirement money is clear his debts. Then travel a little since he never had money to travel in his working days. Once he is done with the debts and leisure....wait for it.... With his remaining retirement money he will now want to start a business after spending 30 years in corporate. Street smart people will never spend 30 years in corporate no matter how much they got paid. At 55, when that business fails it's GAME-OVER for he. But if he is street smart and decide to start a business in his twenties or thirties, he will have time to fail as many times as possible until he gets it right. At 55 he will get a heart attack if a business started with retirement money fails.

Having the "I'm educated" attitude will leave him broke, struggling and in debt. Street smart people will make more money than him and progress faster in life because they do not have the "I'm educated" pride. They are open to selling stuff from the boot of their cars and they are open to any job or business no matter how undignified it may be viewed by society. They do not suffer from "what will people say?" What's the point of having a dignified job title when your bank account is shameful and on overdraft? What's the point of "being educated" if you are going to achieve your goals with personal loans?

Graduates don't let your qualifications prison you. Be open to anything until you find your big break. In most cases, your big break is not even related to your qualification. Don't let your qualifications stereotype you into thinking that there's only one way to make it in life. Don’t be like Uganda’s Abbey Semuwemba.

04/08/2018, 10:49 - +256 701 406572: This is master piece and good advise. The author only forgot to add that Abbey Semuwemba will automatically add another title to his CV - govt critic and will think govt is responsible for his personal welfare. He will think of any celebrity to become President to change his life. Good lessons Doctor and thanks for sharing.

Now he has caused serious internal political struggles in fdc. And I am sure he won't have another term.
08/08/2018, 20:45 - +60 16-475 8556: But I think the elected lady is also very good you remember her in article 102B she was a radical...maybe the environment favoured winnie...young and beautiful...but lets wait for her and see...let's be patient...man dats democracy...even many wanted Mugisha Muntu but democracy decided Amriat...and frictions in the party are normal...it will all end and work together.
08/08/2018, 20:50 - Eria Kamya: This is not democracy
08/08/2018, 20:53 - +256 701 406572: True and good for country. During WWII,  some USA politicians  wanted Hitler assassinated but military commanders refused the idea.  Reason was simple. Hitler was a poor  military strategist and his assassination could bring in a good leader who would re-organise and energise the military campaigns and perhaps defeat the Allies.  Same with FDC now.

12/08/2018, 17:39 - +256 701 406572: Yes my bro. I liked it coz of Malaysian Muslims who are good and different from ones in Mogadishu. It changed my perception. My luggage while checking out at KL was excess.  Airport staff told me to reduce luggage. I told them to remove 12 Quran I was given to give my friends here.  They asked my faith and I told them Iam Xtian. They laughed and told me to park all my luggage and go in peace.  That holy book saved me bro.
12/08/2018, 17:43 - +60 11-6111 5832: There are some few for Quran and islam. Majority is economics , law , medical and social sciences which will be donated to ugandans as well as to a partner university in Uganda (iuiu)

2. I would expect at least a RIP message at the end of that post but all I see is "Police has shot my driver dead thinking they have shot me" . In just minutes Bobi Wine not only knows who has killed his driver but he also knows the motive.

3. Who gains from this incident? Definitely not Police or government. It's important to keep a sober brain in the midst of the storm.
14/08/2018, 03:26 - +60 16-475 8556: Afande otulekangamu netusooka okwekanya...its us to ask you...again yo asking us...🤔
14/08/2018, 03:35 - +60 11-2803 7720: Ofcourse it’s police who we’re waving guns through out the day.
The army, and Prisons which are the other forces that carry such ammunition are not allowed in such public  places with ammunition because it is not their jurisdiction unless called for reinforcement. 
So, can that make Bobi Wine’s conclusion substantial? 

It’s is very clear that NRM and Police strategist do not understand  the basics of Chaos theory and the butterfly effect. 
I am sure Afande that in your sociology and behavioural analysis classes during the Senior command and strategy courses, you meet these terms. 
But certainly, the senior strategist don’t put them to work.

15/08/2018, 20:16 - +256 701 406572: PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT ON MONDAY INCIDENTS IN ARUA TOWN

Countrymen, Countrywomen and, especially, Bazukulu (grandchildren)

I always insist on singling out the grandchildren because I want them to be conversant with our rich experiences spanning a period of 58 years. 

I understand that some of our people were worried about the endless criminal acts of elements of the Opposition, including the incidents of Arua on Monday. 

The elements of the Opposition, including Kassiano Wadri, Kyagulanyi (Bobi Wine) and others, who stoned our convoy, including my vehicle. 

The stones they threw broke the rear glass window of the car where we transport luggage. That window glass is not armoured. There was no harm on the old man with a hat. 

It is a big shame to have such confused people who want to use violence to intimidate Ugandans. Nobody has a right to intimidate any Ugandan by word or action. 

Fortunately, my convoy did not react with fire in response to this attack. This was because we were not equipped for anti-riots. Our intervention could have resulted into people's death because we only had live bullets. 

Unfortunately, this crowd, with a tinga tinga (a grader), apparently continued to the town where they attacked people who were coming from the NRM rally. 

They injured quite a number of people with stones. It was in those scuffles that one of the attackers was shot dead. This is due to the weak management by the Police and the criminal behaviour of some of the Opposition leaders.

Why take supporters in processions through congested streets? The legal thing is to go for the rally at the agreed venue and, after the rally, everybody disperses to his/her home.

Processions are illegal and the NRM leaders should not be part of them because they inconvenience the public. 

Some leaders have been acting with impunity and it has caused the death of one in Bugiri and, now, one person in Arua. These acts are strongly rejected and will be punished according to the law. Anybody who organizes such groups is responsible for their misconduct. 

We went to the bush to fight for the right of making political decisions by Ugandans without intimidation by word or action. Anybody who threatens this will have himself to blame. 

Yoweri Kaguta Museveni
President
15/08/2018, 20:19 - +60 11-2803 7720: Afande let me ask one simple question, as a soldier, would you “shoot to kill” unarmed civilians if they attacked the Presidential motorcade?
15/08/2018, 20:24 - Eria Kamya: Naye the way some questions look irrelevant 🤣🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
15/08/2018, 20:24 - +256 701 406572: No and it's reason the president said the security detail never had anti-riot means.  But also,  it's madness to attempt to do such an act to the person of president of the country.
15/08/2018, 20:26 - Eria Kamya: Afande stop lying. Otherwise you're implying that guns are part of the army uniform.
15/08/2018, 20:27 - +90 535 735 52 19: This is Insane!
15/08/2018, 20:29 - +60 16-639 0643: Bobi Wine caught with a gun.....? Where ever Uganda is going only God knows🙏🏼
15/08/2018, 20:29 - +60 11-6111 5832: Abazukulu 🤣😝 
He wants to win the youth

However the last paragraph is not reflective. 

Again the person of the president is shifting the blame to weak police and angered youths.
15/08/2018, 20:30 - Eria Kamya: You know our president is smart. By that statement he simply wanted to grab the headlines for his consideration of civilians. But me what I know is that a president is a president. Period!
15/08/2018, 20:31 - +60 11-6111 5832: He was also his hiding in the ceiling 🤣.
If someone has a gun he feels confident not hiding like a rat.

NRM is failing to address the youth potentially whom it has to win to their side
15/08/2018, 20:33 - +60 11-2803 7720: Besides that,
I just think the president’s recognisance team was adamant in detail. 

How could they not see that coming? They are the highest paid unit of the army and their only duty is to protect this one man. 

If it actually happened the way it’s narrated by them, then I strongly think this was an insider job to harm the president. 

That laxity and not paying attention to detail to the extent that the president was exposed in that way brings in the doubt.
15/08/2018, 20:36 - +60 11-6111 5832: Mzeei was quick to defend his security saying the car in photos circulating is used to store things. Because for sure it’s a shame if a stone could make such a damage to an armoured car
15/08/2018, 20:39 - Eria Kamya: I don't know who told the public that the entire presidential motorcade is armoured.
15/08/2018, 20:41 - +60 11-2803 7720: Well, 
Allow me to think that every car with a “presidential standard” is the president’s official car. 
At every point in time, there are always two of them in the same motorcade! 
So guess what, it is!
15/08/2018, 20:42 - +44 7914 583339: Not all cars are bullet resistant.
15/08/2018, 20:42 - +44 7914 583339: just the presidents vehicle😒
15/08/2018, 20:42 - +44 7914 583339: vehicles*
15/08/2018, 20:42 - +44 7914 583339: the old man said it himself
15/08/2018, 20:44 - +256 701 406572: This is not about youth grievances. It's purely hooliganism and dirty politics of violence and intimidation which we need to desist as Ugandans irrespective of our political differences
15/08/2018, 20:49 - Eria Kamya: Having a presidential standard, or even having the president himself seated in it doesn't make it armoured. This is made in the factory. You notice the presidential cars have white seat covers if you have ever observed it. This was a mere old model V8.

 Remember presidential vehicles are also serviced. And also the presidential standard is a mere symbol that can be put on any vehicle for a presidential journey.
15/08/2018, 20:51 - +60 11-6111 5832: An analysis has been made and the photo of the car and what was said from official communication director of presidency contradict. Something is not said and white propaganda is in play.

I have personally seen the presendential convoy and any slight mistake those SFC soldiers don’t mess. 

Just simple cars not giving way and they warn you with anger 
So if a stone was thrown those guys all alert to deal with an enemy.
If one vehicle misses the incident another doesn’t.

Something is not really adding up tbh.

Where the guy was short and the said vehicle which had hooligans are different scenes. 

If you connect the dots, there is a gap in between. However a president is a president that his cars ought to be special for a stone to smash the entire rear window
15/08/2018, 20:54 - +90 535 735 52 19: I think when peace fails,  that is when people employ force. It's very evident that the opposition is having the majority vote, so?
15/08/2018, 20:58 - +60 11-2803 7720: Thank you Mr. Kamya Eria. 
However, to the contrary, there is protocol on how to issue and use a presidential standard. 
Protocol dictates that only president’s official cars will have a “presidential standard.”

This is not some sort of flag or license plate you can get anywhere, it is issued by protocol and used following protocol. 
All other cars in the motorcade apart from police and the army cars  have *UG XXXX C* as license plates. 
Therefore, if it had a presidential standard, it is president’s official car, so, it most probably going to be armoured. 

Note: there is no indication whatsoever that President’s was using it at the time it was allegedly hit.
15/08/2018, 20:59 - Eria Kamya: My president is very trendy 🤣🤣 there's no way he could have been in that old model V8. That's why he uses it for carrying luggage 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
15/08/2018, 21:01 - +60 11-6111 5832: That aside if NRM loses in this election 🗳 it indicates something.
15/08/2018, 21:04 - +60 11-3637 6788: <Media omitted>
15/08/2018, 21:04 - Eria Kamya: Protocol will always be followed before desperate times come. Secondly, there's no protocol that doesn't listen to orders from above. That's the army my brother.
15/08/2018, 21:05 - +60 11-6111 5832: Delayed justice to late Abiriga 
Where no one knows the truth and mzeei says we went to the bush bla bla. For a man who did A-Z to worship him. 
Security is better to the days of our fathers but we must acknowledge that we can’t have poor facilities , high unemployment and insecurity at the same time.
15/08/2018, 21:08 - Eria Kamya: That's less of an issue right now, since nrm is now used to losing by-elections. The issue is about the future of bobi wine in Uganda's politics given the alleged charges on him right now.
15/08/2018, 21:16 - +60 11-6111 5832: It’s clear cut Kyagulanyi was going to taste the wrath of state machinery. How he overcomes this remains to be seen. 
I guess he was intoxicated as well and he may be weaker to be on slidelines until 2021. 
With treason , court is going to be his second home if not prison. For a span of 1-2 yrs he will be in court as other strategies against him will surface to calm down his popularity amongst opposition to NRM. 

After elections of 2016 , Mzeei promised to wipe out opposition to near nonexistent and its evident how the political parties are declining in support.
Emergency of Kyagulanyi and co is something they will deal with in ways they have frustrated Besigye.
15/08/2018, 21:19 - +60 11-2803 7720: Unlike the army, protocol officers do not take orders. 
They are trained not to take orders from whom they protect. It is the other way round, the president takes orders from protocol officers. 
Nonetheless, they are highly disciplined that you won’t notice any of this!
15/08/2018, 21:22 - Eria Kamya: But bobi wine then seems to have learnt nothing from besigye, and how to act smarter to the government. Recently besigye said bitter truth to him but the public criticised him instead. Now he's gonna taste it. 

I also didn't like the way bobi wine provoked besigye at his rally in Arua. I hope you guys watched that video when bobi tried to even draw besigye's supporters away from him.
15/08/2018, 21:28 - Eria Kamya: Hehehe, bro this guy is the commander-in-chief. I have ever witnessed the president shouting angrily at his body guard yet he was doing his job.
15/08/2018, 21:30 - +60 11-2803 7720: The bodyguard is a presidential subject. He can do whatever he wants to him!
15/08/2018, 21:37 - Eria Kamya: I agree with you that the president takes orders from the protocol, but only for programme orders. But even this is minimal with our president.
15/08/2018, 21:40 - +60 16-475 8556: Naye Afande oli mukalukalu notafuna nakunsonyi kusindika bya bulimba wano oba mulowoza tuli basiru...oba tetutegeera simanyi...yiiyi olimbye nnyo muko...those are his usual words by the way its not even his words...u people yo so arrogant...Instead of apologising for what you did,again yo proudly extending yo mistakes to opposition...so pity....naye lwebali tuwa emmundu ebitabo tugya biza bali nze nkubulira...👋🏾

You guys I pity those who defend you in public coz they have a big task...here its like being in a ring when yo arms are tied up together...and still the guy beats you with a knock out...what does it imply?

15/08/2018, 23:29 - +60 16-475 8556: Thats what they can do instead of improving lives of Ugandans...cowards...so shameful with no sense lies...
16/08/2018, 00:12 - +256 755 911999: I did that kyankwanzi training.... Court martial is for arm people...not civilians.....the fact that they did it once doesn't make it correct...that said, I would rather non partisan people attend these hearings that way we are able to get unbiased reports.... Also for the prime minister to stand and contradict himself is boring....like y would anyone be in hospital if they were okay???
16/08/2018, 00:29 - +60 16-475 8556: Man...hmm dats y I said that those who defend this govt in public have a big task now checķ such a primary sch.statement hospital is not church...is like prison or police only go there with cases  to answer or yo criminal...or meet yo criminal...
16/08/2018, 00:31 - +60 16-475 8556: You can never defend a dictator...bse you end up being criticised about ur integrity and reasoning..

16/08/2018, 06:22 - +60 11-2803 7720: Sometimes when I read things in this WhatsApp forum, you may think Uganda is burning. Like a war torn place. 
Just worse than South Sudan 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Guys, I just want to remind you that Uganda is ok. 
Everything there is ok, nothing much to worry about. The country is functioning and also, E.K Sekandi is our Vice President 🤗🤗
16/08/2018, 06:25 - Eria Kamya: Hehehe you be there giving us false confidence. Uganda is on fire but latently. 🤣🤣🤣🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
16/08/2018, 06:25 - +60 16-475 8556: Justify your statement boss if parliament is not ok ...and you say ug is ok..people burying their loved ones and you say its ok...may be to you...
16/08/2018, 06:27 - +60 16-475 8556: Us we have families in activism so sometimes we are not settled...🤷🏿‍♂
16/08/2018, 06:28 - +60 11-2803 7720: Nothing much. 
Uganda has gone through a lot. Reflect back to History. 
The 1998-99 Famine,
The Besigye Fracus of 2000

The kabaka bugerere crisis
The Masiro fire

Name it, 
So, forget this social media hype up, things are ok!
16/08/2018, 06:34 - +60 11-5359 0769: With all due respect, I believe you don't knw the meaning of "ok" mr.
16/08/2018, 07:16 - +256 701 406572: It's wrong to lie that only members of Armed Forces are court martialled. It's  based crime characteristics not profession. If you commit a crime with a gun or put on military uniform, or engage a crime with armed personnel or aid them,  etc,  you become good candidate of court marshial.
16/08/2018, 07:24 - +256 701 406572: Thanks Daaki. People are now security experts on social media exaggerating simple things. The country is peaceful. Arua was one isolated incidence and people are now happy and no post-election violence. Since there are democratic channels in place,  we will never allow politics of intimidation and violence to always disrupt other peace loving citizens.

17/08/2018, 08:46 - Eria Kamya: But I really feel pity for Ugandans who think that the president can be intimidated, especially in the bobi wine case.
17/08/2018, 08:48 - +60 16-475 8556: Bawoza amini yali mubi nyo yata bameka? Who has records? Obote yata bameka? Naye m7 on record kakadde kalamba e luwero katudde...nze dats y I call him Shetan...thinking bagenda muziika neyuganda...oba alowoza batabani be nabaddu be bo bali jikungula?
17/08/2018, 08:55 - Eria Kamya: My advice for those who love bobi, better go to the streets with posters of apologies for your guy.

 Otherwise this mzee can not be intimidated for two key reasons; he's an army guy who fought his way into power having killed many innocent people. Therefore innocent people are not an issue to him. 

The second thing is that he's getting old. The older he gets, the less he cares about people and what they say. Naturally when one gets older, their probability of dying tends to 1 and they're aware of it. So dying with others is not an issue for them.

17/08/2018, 10:13 - +256 755 911999: If he isn't intimidated why is he harrasing him? Why does he feel the need to plant guns in his things...make up stories have him tortured!? Hmmm
17/08/2018, 14:08 - Eria Kamya: Why did bobi use the statement of *removing the president from his seat* in Arua?  If that was a presidential campaign rally, it would be okay because it would mean removing him by ballot. But this was an mp campaign situation meaning that removing the president would mean using forceful means such as attacking his convoy (as it's being alleged apparently). So with those statements from bobi and later presidential attacks follow up, means a lot. In fact I was wondering how the army came to necessitate bobi's hotel room searching but later realised that they can use such statements as their back up. Because someone who threatens to remove the president especially in a non-presidential election period must have other means and hence armed backup.

The only thing that remains totally unclear and easily unbelievable is the existence of military equipment in his room.
17/08/2018, 14:17 - +60 11-2895 6258: https://youtu.be/B0K1dCNEXR4
17/08/2018, 15:26 - +256 755 911999: Spin it however rocks your boat. Because we've also heard the president saying disturbing statements or that Lumumba chic and the day after  some random things happen. So..
17/08/2018, 15:46 - Eria Kamya: I don't think the president ever says any disturbing statements unless responding to someone.
17/08/2018, 15:51 - +256 755 911999: I am not going to argue with you over the president, his ways his rule nothing. Have your opinion il have mine. Bobi Wine is the symbol of restless youth. Kizza Besigye and Sevo are agemates and were youth then.... They are basically the same coin....just different sides. We have nothing in common with their time and ours.... Its just what it is..so let's relax n just serve our country to the best of our ability. You defending the govt won't exempt you from ott so
17/08/2018, 16:14 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣 I am not defending government in any case. I am just wondering how some politicians don't know how to act smarter and in the dot com way. People think that history can help them out. That's why our upcoming politicians are stubbornly unleashing themselves. In this way, they think that the history they're using as precedence applies here. Yet many things have changed. Our history is characterised by unpeaceful  transitions and revolutions. And this is what people think is gonna work out in this era. Never! We can choose the humble way. A time can come when even the electoral commission can't do anything for him. 

It's simply a matter of understanding that some people have idle resources at their disposal and therefore go slow on them. Our president for example has many idle soldiers and equipment at his disposal. Therefore people better go slow on him but still pursue your political objectives. Simple. We're living in a highly technological era and information spreads fast. Therefore you don't have to choose violence, chaos, intimidation and any other sort of such to put your point forward to your supporters. People will know. 

You look at people like hussein kyanjo, Betty nambooze and others and should be able to learn from that. But now bobi wine is in their full possession and they can do anything they want to him. 🤷‍♂

17/08/2018, 16:55 - Eria Kamya: You know people who don't want to accept the truth suffer in the long run. People also don't want to find better and sustainable solutions. Instead they go for short-term solutions. The problem comes from concentrating on the wrong things at wrong times. This is why our bro is suffering right now. And we the youth are actually not helping him at all. Maybe he's also not the listening type. 

I remember one time when the lord mayor won the mayoral seat and in his celebration indicated that he had defeated the president. Since then, he has never enjoyed his seat, not even influenced anything. This is because of concentrating on the wrong things, at the wrong time in the right position. 

The same is what our brother is doing with false support from the youth. Me personally I can't sustain a war for a week. That's why I blame people who choose violence with people who sustained wars for over four years. And this era is full of coward youths who can just talk. 

Besigye suffered and also lost his brother in the struggle. But when he advised bobi wine people instead misunderstood him. It was only a few weeks later that something serious is happening to him. People are very hard to understand, please as well as advise.
17/08/2018, 17:05 - Eria Kamya: All of us want a better Uganda.
17/08/2018, 17:06 - +60 16-475 8556: Lem deserve my comment for the betterment of our group...otherwise tugya kubeera nga abali mu kuzanya akawuna...🙏

17/08/2018, 19:25 - +60 16-475 8556: Firstly   Bobiwinez brother chairman nyanzi was  target  not that innocent driver and hes a moslem yii wabula abasiramu bambi balabye ku mulembe gwomusajja oyo.Bobiz brother babadde bamuli bubi recently kuwamba mayumba ge kumukubakuba kino kiri paka mukomera Bobi gyeyamujja.

17/08/2018, 21:30 - Eria Kamya: 🙆‍♂🙆‍♂🙆‍♂ by the time you (an outsider) come to a conclusion that bobi's bro was the target, then it means that bobi wine also knew knew about the killing and hence substituted his brother for Yasin. This I say because you're far from that family but you already know that. 

Secondly, when I talk about false support, I mean many aspects in it. First of all you're hyping his political welcome too much. The second aspect of false support can directly be evidenced from the false support that besigye was given. No one seriously fought for him. Time always came when he was left to battle with his goals alone. This is because Ugandans can not persist longer in any protest. Today they protest, tomorrow they're back to their normal work and the key victim is left alone thereafter. Another aspect of false support is among the other opposition politicians. Of course now you'll see them reverting to besigye. I hope you understand what I mean here. Bobi risked his life for them and they're busy handling things at their own pace. 

If besigye didn't have false support he would be the president now. When his eyes were sprayed with pepper, his brother killed, etc, what did you Ugandans do? Nothing was done that lasted for two days. You hear people lamenting, "besigye won the 2006 and 2011 elections",but the same people did nothing to see him take the seat. 

So those are some of my precedences when I talk about the false confidence and support that Ugandans give their beloved political leaders. 

I hear mbu M7 uses witch craft 😝😝 naye guy gwe. Ebyo naawe byakyaalo nyooo. There's no witch craft here. The guy is simply privileged because he controls the key institutions. Recently gashumba said that M7 is hard to topple because of his control over the central bank, security forces and something else I've forgotten. Simple. 

Of course he is a broad daylight dictator. Therefore when you realise that you're dealing with a dictator, then your strategy should be different. But this is not what people are doing. 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
18/08/2018, 04:01 - +60 16-475 8556: Try to reason more from where  I started..
18/08/2018, 04:02 - +60 16-475 8556: When we dicussing Bobi and other things don't bring yo Besigye...unless you don't know what is going on in Ugandaz politics...the challenge am facing is that some of you do not read books at all.you don't watch any political programs at all both local and international..you get news from Facebook...and you get false info from other media...you don't listen international and local political analysts...that's y you don't and cannot understand news behind news...whether Bobi new abt it or not its not my concern. I just gave my conclusion from what I have been following...two they were two guys in Tundra...have you heard what the survivor narrated if Bobi knew about it? conclude what you can defend...Yo Besigye is the false opposition...we gave him our votes more than enough and after court says for the good of our country what was rigged can not affect results..every term..not only me  even that guy "Inseparable" told you that Besigye is working for m7...hez a second option for bazirwanako if things fall apart for m7...that spray you talking about was done by his cozn son.he wanted to disorganise the meeting m7 was holding at that time...in most of his strategies temubadde erimu byamagezi...then here comes a new hope for Ugandans a true opposition not false one...for m7 being a servant of Shetan ekyo sigya kusomesa abakimanyi bakimanyi..atakimanyi abeera muzibe...bse you look at matters in one aspect...that's physical you cannot go spiritual I know but just try to read books...but dat info is for those who are supposed to know coz they are interested...I may affect you if yo not patient...omanyi man njagala nyo to discuss nomuntu asoma ku international politics dats when you will realise y m7 is still in power..we don't need him..citizens in East Africa are tired of him but international bankers,war mongers(usa...uk.. saud...isreal.and others in that group) they need him..he enables them to steal African resources..keep insecurity and  to control Africa...coz they control a bigger portion of the world...if you go international you will understand why...and they are powerfull just like their god...and so m7 twists us in anyway...if you serve them well they rank you freedom fighter peace keeper..despite the killings and suffering you circum to pple...and remember himself also has got his own agendas and if you divert from them thats yo end...humanrights comes in and non governmental organisations start to criticise and sponsor resistances against you...and kyekimu ku byatisa Nyakairima..he wanted to asses and abolish some of them..he never realised that  would be the end of his master plus rejections of crime preventers who did a wonderful job for him so he had  to be eliminated...
18/08/2018, 04:02 - +60 16-475 8556: enway so many issues but I would end there.
18/08/2018, 04:05 - +60 16-475 8556: and you have to know that abayekera like two groups are there but they know the guy has support from bigger powers so they cannot just wage war but are there quiet.only one or two mistakes his masters will surrender him to them...
18/08/2018, 04:07 - +60 16-475 8556: But always try to look for info behind info..or news behind news...others call it the inside stories and always from independent analysts...
18/08/2018, 06:08 - Eria Kamya: Let me first secure my distinction in the next four hours, will get back to our discussion bro. Thanks

18/08/2018, 12:19 - Eria Kamya: I must admit something to myself that I have potential in analysing things on my own and rely less on books, other politicians and other agencies like some of you. I just talked about we people hyping our politicians without action when mostly needed and besigye has just said the same thing again. In fact everything I talked he has too stressed it, including how smart we should act these days. 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂ 

Some of you don't realise that we are not living in history but in the current.
18/08/2018, 12:23 - Eria Kamya: So my brother Kalungi, I hope you watch that video while it's still live. Then reflect back to what I said earlier. You will know that I live in the current and that's how I look at issues.
18/08/2018, 12:40 - +60 16-475 8556: But I told you I don't need Besigye in my discussion ..its a coin of different sides with M7 dats y...two if you don't read you may lack direction..not all dat glitter is gold...things are not the way you observe...
18/08/2018, 14:13 - Eria Kamya: Now that's the problem with not being objective in the way you see things. Objectivity is very important because it suppresses biased analysis. If you observe my way of looking at things, I am very objective. Sometimes I blame government, sometimes it's opposition. Because either the government or the opposition, can't be good every time and in everything. But me I can't watch the opposition do a terrible mistake and I simply sympathise with them. No!! Because that's how they're keeping this guy in power. I really feel very bad when M7 proves smarter than these guys and also exercises his bad dictatorship practices on the same people. Right now he has all the authority and power. But at least anyone else can be smart. It's the best we can be in terms of fighting him.
18/08/2018, 14:31 - +60 16-475 8556: hahaha am biased bse I understand news behind news...one problem ugandans you have...that they kp him in power...it's u keeping him in power...you think for them are Angels?..assuming the whole opposition was created by him just like the are with Besigye...who to blame you who is blind or opposition who are gaining from everything? you Ugandans fear to face death most of you and you think yo grands will be safe...you want trump or Xi.Ping or Queen to fight for you...dats y we cannot be independent...as we call neighbours for everything...mwagala biwedde nga bano abalangira be Uganda...

18/08/2018, 16:14 - Eria Kamya: All of us want change, but the change must come with humble leaders. Not stubborn leaders because they're likely to stagnate us at such a very promising time. The Arua events are apparently not clear to me about how they unfolded. But at least the only video I have seen clearly is that of bobi wine trying to intimidate besigye's supporters. Now such a person who does that while still looking for a position, what will they be when they get the position. Just give them the power and you'll have given them the wings. How do you interrupt someone's rally? That's why as I sympathise with him I also leave room for blaming him. If he did that to besigye what about to the president who he had earlier on declared to remove from his seat. 

So as we sympathise with him, he should also be blamed. Of course what's happening to him is totally the worst picture of this government and it's really bad. But as I try to question the allegations on him, I at least have seen elements of disrespectful behaviour and provocation others in him. Yet ethics and integrity must be upheld everywhere.
18/08/2018, 16:15 - Eria Kamya: Am glad you're starting to agree with me

Good enough he did the opposite of what he's expert in, because it'd be more dangerous.
19/08/2018, 12:18 - +60 11-2803 7720: Wow!

19/08/2018, 13:01 - +60 16-475 8556: Instead of taking the guy for serious surgical treatments...just like the rest are getting...tell him that we can also turn into animals just like the way he's doing...there's no monopoly over that...let him kill the guy at once but not in pain...let them inject the chemical that stops the heart...instead of dying in pain...musajja mukulu naye he's spirit less..

In my whole life as UPDF servant, I have never witnessed torture and we don't believe in it. It's barbaric and not a tool in this century. Only God is our witness and close family of all the suspects. Hooliganism, intimidation and violence has no place in the politics of our country
19/08/2018, 14:33 - +60 17-364 3269: Lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. Besigye used to beat himself , ingrid made her self naked . I don’t want to talk about the rest . This is funny .

19/08/2018, 14:42 - +256 701 406572: Mugisha Muntu has never been tortured coz the way he conducts himself. Torture is administered when you cause pain to an arrested person in your detention facility.  But during arrest at the scene of crime is always infighting between groups and it's risky.  I wish all citizens desist from causing havoc or resisting police arrest. Security personnel at lower level at the scene don't know this politicians

19/08/2018, 14:44 - +60 17-364 3269: Ur right , people should not resist from arrest . But people have a right to resist a wrong full arrest
19/08/2018, 14:44 - +60 16-475 8556: shame is a broad word but I don't mean it's broad meaning however,shame is there for credible ppl and those with integrity

19/08/2018, 14:45 - +60 17-364 3269: U can not arrest people who r peacefully demonstrating , that have been allowed by u , the police to demonstrate . Then u arrest them . That’s wrongful arrest . Police abusing its power . So people have a right to resist such arrest .
19/08/2018, 14:46 - +60 16-475 8556: was mugisha at gun point...firstly he's a soldier he knows the rule of the game.these are civilians.

Why take him to martial court , wen he is not even a soldier . Why hide him . Why not come out and prove to the world that bobi really attempted to kill him . Why hid n torture him . M7 is just creating more enemies and hate for himself . People love bobi not just as a politician but as a person as well . There has to be an open court . If there is still any justice in our country

19/08/2018, 14:56 - Eria Kamya: Actually it may not matter whether someone is taken to a military court. But you can not torture a mere suspect. The case itself maybe a military court issue but the way they should handle people should be professional enough.
19/08/2018, 14:58 - Eria Kamya: You should never think that people interpret things like you do. The day you'll say that to a short tempered Muslim who has never been to a bar, you'll remember me.
19/08/2018, 14:58 - +60 16-475 8556: have a video...a military guy bamusalidde gwakufa naye bamuleeta mu dembe wadde noluyi kuba yatta abaana..no torture no what...that guy wants my guy dead..
19/08/2018, 14:59 - Eria Kamya: By the time you'll have explained yourself that it's a slogan..... Hehehe
19/08/2018, 14:59 - +60 16-475 8556: ate a moslem atanywa ategeera atya emboozi zamalwa..?
19/08/2018, 15:00 - Eria Kamya: Exactly
19/08/2018, 15:00 - +60 16-475 8556: Don't make it a matter here...don't change my antenna
19/08/2018, 15:01 - Eria Kamya: Which religion do you belong to?
19/08/2018, 15:02 - +60 16-475 8556: https://youtu.be/DmPJozI8YS4
19/08/2018, 15:03 - +60 16-475 8556: sirina diini nina nzikiriza...religions were created to divide man...
19/08/2018, 15:04 - Eria Kamya: Okay which faith do uphold?
19/08/2018, 15:04 - Eria Kamya: Do you
19/08/2018, 15:05 - +60 16-475 8556: can you gt a serious discussion bro...simanyi oli mbegga..onsobedde..
19/08/2018, 15:08 - Eria Kamya: 😂😂😂😂 I always emphasise ethical discussions and less personal ones. Otherwise you'll end up discouraging others.
19/08/2018, 15:08 - +60 16-475 8556: nababuziiza gyemuva tewali yayogedde nemanya kirabika wabaswaaza..nombuuza jenva nenkubulirayo kati ombuuza diini nze ndi ku current situation in my country ebyo bwoligya ku mbagga yange nga sobodde ojitukako olimanya ebinkwatako.
19/08/2018, 15:10 - Eria Kamya: You said some of us and you never specified who 😂
19/08/2018, 15:11 - +60 16-475 8556: kikyaamu ki ate awo tell me...oyagala naked lies zebabagamba wano nemuzifuula headlines?..have not insulted anyone though am offf and just trying to step on smonez lies...only that am too serious abalala muli mu lwaali...
19/08/2018, 15:14 - +60 16-475 8556: y shd specify ate that means am biased in the process man...These are issues concerning our pple yo grands and my grands can not dwell on smone gwesimanyi blood...🤔 hmm ndeka nze
19/08/2018, 15:16 - Eria Kamya: Of course he may have lied nakedly, but probably he was telling you what he believes in or what he knows is the right thing.
19/08/2018, 15:18 - +60 11-2803 7720: Police used to beat and to torture Besigye, the Police also undressed women! 
UPDF and the army were in the barracks chilling. 
They shouldn’t be blamed for Police’s actions
19/08/2018, 15:19 - +60 16-475 8556: now what does this statement mean..mr Kamya digest it for me
19/08/2018, 15:20 - Eria Kamya: Actually while they chilled, they must have been wishing it was them handling these guys. Because we have seen what they can also do when called upon to handle suspects. 🤷‍♂
19/08/2018, 15:21 - +60 11-2803 7720: You have to refer to what I replied to.
19/08/2018, 15:21 - +60 16-475 8556: naye kirabika wano waliwo ba guys abeteesa nti kati sulayo kano...bagambe kino...such that we control or divert them...
19/08/2018, 15:23 - +60 11-2803 7720: Mr. Kalungi, everyone is entitled to their opinion. 
Even when the opinion isn’t the same as yours.
19/08/2018, 15:24 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
19/08/2018, 15:26 - +60 16-475 8556: Hahaha but you cannot be at the church or mosque and smone asks which type of beer is better on Christmas..or idhi man that person is too far from the focal point..
19/08/2018, 15:28 - +60 16-475 8556: enway may be its my weakness okulowoza nti bwetuba mukisiibo then olwegulo buli muntu enjala eba emuluma..dats my thinking and a weakness am sry

19/08/2018, 15:38 - +60 17-631 2833: I don't believe this voice note museven him self planted all of them so that he can kick him out of his way
19/08/2018, 15:40 - +60 17-631 2833: Andrew Mwenda had keep🤐😷
19/08/2018, 15:42 - Eria Kamya: 😂😂😂😂😂
19/08/2018, 15:44 - +60 17-631 2833: Besigye his now minding his own for now
19/08/2018, 15:48 - +60 17-631 2833: Bobi has to be more vigilant and fast talk to those who were there before and ask why they were shut up.  He has to come in a deferent way
19/08/2018, 15:53 - +60 17-631 2833: **BREAKING NEWS**

Your Prayers are needed now more than Ever.
19/08/2018, 15:56 - Eria Kamya: 😂 😂😂 don't scare us naawe with funny Facebook speculations.
19/08/2018, 15:57 - +60 17-631 2833: 😎
19/08/2018, 16:00 - +60 11-2803 7720: Sometimes I wonder! 
I just sit down SMH wondering.
19/08/2018, 16:05 - Eria Kamya: But if I can ask, God forbid. What do you guys think can happen to our country in case bobi wine dies in the hands of these army guys?
19/08/2018, 16:50 - Eria Kamya: Two people have been shot dead in mityana riots. 🤔🤔🤔
19/08/2018, 17:20 - +60 16-475 8556: Police has shot several times at a taxi full of people that were heading for a football match...the Buganda games killing one gentleman instantly and severely injuring many of them
19/08/2018, 17:21 - +60 16-475 8556: wulira ebyo ate...
19/08/2018, 17:21 - +60 16-475 8556: hmm
19/08/2018, 17:22 - +256 701 406572: The role model for peaceful demonstrations was Gandi of India. He was law abiding but his peaceful sit down strikes broke the Mighty British Colonial rule in India. Violence methods meet violence response and it becomes risky.
19/08/2018, 17:24 - Eria Kamya: I think by the time we get out of this crisis, general kayihura will have been diplomatically resettled in another country.
19/08/2018, 17:25 - Eria Kamya: You don't need to take us to mahatma gandhi. Even our independence struggles were peaceful
19/08/2018, 17:29 - +60 16-475 8556: 🙆🏿‍♂🙆🏿‍♂🤣🤣🤭 mpozi naye jyaali..?
19/08/2018, 17:29 - +60 16-475 8556: ate kitata...hahaha
19/08/2018, 17:31 - +60 16-475 8556: kale nabo baliiwo..but they cannot resettle him in this crisis...in any case smthng happens bamukwasa a brigade or a group to command in war...they need him still...
19/08/2018, 17:36 - Eria Kamya: Kale all this would have been prevented by the age limit bill. But these nrm mps didn't see that. And more is yet to come.
19/08/2018, 17:38 - +60 16-475 8556: kituufu ekyo kyekyaawo opposition amaanyi ate even if it was not Bobi...it wud Mukulu Mugisha oba ba mw.Nsereko...
19/08/2018, 17:38 - Eria Kamya: That was a very pivotal time in Uganda's politics
19/08/2018, 17:39 - +60 16-475 8556: now I believe all those abajikwatako may not come back to parliament 2021..if situation continues like it is currently.
19/08/2018, 17:40 - +60 16-475 8556: we gona have like 15 musicians in parliament
19/08/2018, 17:46 - +256 701 406572: Thanks Daaki
19/08/2018, 17:47 - Eria Kamya: Some may come back surprisingly. But that was the right time to shape our future. Because I just can't imagine what M7 would have done if the Parliament had peacefully voted against the age limit lifting. Of course he would not challenge anything since it would be a constitutional decision by Parliament. He would simply wind up his regime. But now we're with him soole kungatto 😂🤷‍♂
19/08/2018, 17:51 - +60 16-475 8556: No blood bano ba guy balina three plans for that article...and plan A was that...if it failed they wud go to referendum and rig votes..
19/08/2018, 17:51 - +256 701 406572: God is watching all these lies
19/08/2018, 17:52 - +60 16-475 8556: and plan C is ovcos the dictatorship regime...
19/08/2018, 17:52 - Eria Kamya: And watching the tortures as well
19/08/2018, 17:53 - +60 16-475 8556: I remember one time I wrote here that mzee by 2020  he will be a total dictator...according to sm book I read...now see the yields still 2018
19/08/2018, 17:54 - +256 701 406572: 😂😂😂. But Kamya you always use humour to provoke me always
19/08/2018, 17:54 - Eria Kamya: Ate who would endorse the referendum? I thought the same Parliament right? They would simply not endorse the referendum.
19/08/2018, 17:57 - +60 16-475 8556: man in ug everything is possible remember parliament had requested for referendum as it is in constitution that power belongs to pple..have you forgotten that when opposition said we go referendum
19/08/2018, 17:57 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣 no I don't intend to provoke you. I always speak for both sides. This is because I am not a colour like red which can never change to blue. 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
19/08/2018, 17:58 - Eria Kamya: Then what happened
19/08/2018, 17:58 - +60 16-475 8556: F.good..
19/08/2018, 17:59 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🙈
19/08/2018, 17:59 - +60 16-475 8556: anti we have the majje and more seatss in parliament.
19/08/2018, 17:59 - +60 16-475 8556: That's NRM
19/08/2018, 18:02 - Eria Kamya: That's why I also included the nrm mps in my statement. Because who would propose for a referendum after both the majority of nrm and the opposition voting against the age limit lifting? Anyone who would push for a referendum would still lose it in parliament.
19/08/2018, 18:03 - Eria Kamya: Then what would the majje do?
19/08/2018, 18:06 - +60 16-475 8556: protect the nrm mpz who were intimidated by opposition that mulya munsi yamwe olukwe..and strongly stated they will not allow the bill to be passed as they did at first...singing the ug.anthem till they failed to pass it...led by Bobi and Nsereko and madam Nambooze..
19/08/2018, 18:09 - +60 16-475 8556: now second time they brought the sfc after opposition using other tactics to fail it...allegations Min.Kibuule came with pistol in parliament and he had not been screened...so kavuyo started from there...man it serious...katemba...law...interesting and pitiful
19/08/2018, 18:13 - Eria Kamya: But does the opposition know the weakest points of M7?  Have they even ever tried to bother discovering his weak points? or they just attack like sheep. Because sometimes strategy matters a lot.
19/08/2018, 18:18 - +60 16-475 8556: you can't be smart when yo poor...
19/08/2018, 18:18 - +60 16-475 8556: mzee last resort is military now who can conquer the military?
19/08/2018, 18:22 - +60 16-475 8556: mzee has only 2 Mz..military and money...he shares the third M with us or them and thats the media...and its bse those in media are like us also poor thats y we share it...
19/08/2018, 18:32 - +60 16-475 8556: he doesn't want a quiet and peaceful nation no...he senses danger...he loves demonstrations...and the likes..there he's settled he knows this is what they want but if everyone is quiet and at peace...he fears that mostly understand what i mean by that..so if you're quiet he brings up something that makes you biz...too peaceful he brings up conflicts esp.in tribes...see the Basoga two kings...the Bakonjo...you hear  the banyala...again for Tooro again uncle of king wants to take over many things then he penetrates the religions...catholics divided...though no much conflicts between them then mualims we have old kampala and Kibuli and also Nakasero..u see so he spends all yrs playing that kind of...it helps him to divide and cntrol us as everyone runs to him as the source of honour you know...he elects kings...so thats the way man.
19/08/2018, 18:40 - +60 16-475 8556: so Bobi came in and started awekening pple esp.the youth...who were brain washed...those who had lost hope...those who didn't believe in themselves and purely taught unity yet mzee uses divide and rule so he became a threat...he was showing corruption and how its practiced...he emphasised that this is yo money boys and gals...he openly aired all their buzinas and he was winning crowds...trust me if we went like so NRM was loosing it all...he forced youths to stand for LC1 and told youths to elect fellow youths man it was fire...remember he's rich and young.. he stands out as a standing example...even other oppositions were jealousy coz he was just a yr and winning crowds bro...
19/08/2018, 18:50 - +256 701 406572: https://kampalapost.com/index.php/content/opinion/museveni-speaks-out-bobi-wines-health-condition
19/08/2018, 19:07 - +60 11-6111 5832: <Media omitted>
19/08/2018, 19:08 - +60 17-364 3269: Alright , so then why is the army saying they r treating him . M7 n his lies . Wat r they treating if they didn’t torture him
19/08/2018, 19:17 - +256 701 406572: It's what I said.  Mzee has repeated. Mistreatment of Prisoners. Someone becomes a prisoner after arrest. When you resist arrest, minimum force is used to compel a suspect. He is not yet a prisoner till he is in detention hands.  UPDF has never tortured any suspect in its hands.  It's what makes me serve my nation with love and patriotism coz tomorrow I may be in same detention and I have confidence of UPDF justice system. The most disciplined force on the continent.
19/08/2018, 19:18 - +60 17-364 3269: Ok , then explain his wounds
19/08/2018, 19:18 - +60 17-364 3269: How did he get the injuries he has
19/08/2018, 19:19 - +60 17-364 3269: Mzee says a lot of things , he lies about . I can write a full book of the things he said b turned out to b lies
19/08/2018, 19:20 - +256 701 406572: Resisting arrest in his hotel and trying to engage the security forces. But social media exaggerating simple  things
19/08/2018, 19:21 - +60 17-364 3269: Resisting arrest , they didn’t show us how they arrested him . How do hurt someone’s kidney . While arresting him . How does he sounds that looked like he was beaten . Bse he was being arrested
19/08/2018, 19:21 - +60 17-364 3269: No matter how much u deny it
19/08/2018, 19:22 - +60 17-364 3269: BOBI HAS BEEN TORTURED .
19/08/2018, 19:22 - +60 17-364 3269: The injuries he has are more than just resisting arrest .
19/08/2018, 19:23 - +60 17-364 3269: So he was resisting arrest , then he got punched for it .
19/08/2018, 19:23 - +60 11-6111 5832: Most arrests caught on camera show more than 5 security persons against one suspect.
19/08/2018, 19:24 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes they do , but have u ever had besigye with a damaged kidney
19/08/2018, 19:25 - +60 11-6111 5832: I once saw a video of 10 police men beating one bodaboda guy.FACT
19/08/2018, 19:25 - +60 17-364 3269: N that is abuse of police power
19/08/2018, 19:26 - Eria Kamya: What is being insinuated here? 🤷‍♂
19/08/2018, 19:26 - +60 17-364 3269: I told u ug police is organised crime
19/08/2018, 19:26 - +60 11-6111 5832: Same goes to the army mzeei is saying it’s indisciplined. 
In the previous press release , mzeei said there was reckless handling by police
19/08/2018, 19:27 - +60 11-6111 5832: And police also claimed arresting not the army
19/08/2018, 19:28 - +60 11-6111 5832: Mzeei is intimidating everyone now especially Bobi Wine
19/08/2018, 19:28 - +60 17-364 3269: The point is , he could not have gotten the kind of injuries due to just resist of arrest . The kind of injuries he got show a more story , the story that the government is hiding from  us
19/08/2018, 19:28 - Eria Kamya: What could be the story?
19/08/2018, 19:28 - +60 17-364 3269: Mzee commands every organisation in Uganda , if the police is indisciplined he has reaped wat he sowed
19/08/2018, 19:29 - +60 17-364 3269: It’s more than that . My biggest guess is that they tortured him while they were questioning him
19/08/2018, 19:30 - +60 17-364 3269: I think they interrogated him .
19/08/2018, 19:30 - +60 17-364 3269: That’s my guess . It might not be the case . But those injuries tell a more stories . Politicians should stop taking us for fools
19/08/2018, 19:31 - Eria Kamya: I know you're trying to mean that M7 and besigye are the same, something I can never agree to.
19/08/2018, 19:31 - +60 17-364 3269: I didn’t even think of that
19/08/2018, 19:31 - +60 17-364 3269: No where did I put besigye
19/08/2018, 19:32 - +60 17-364 3269: Am talking about bobi’s injuries
19/08/2018, 19:34 - Eria Kamya: What did you insinuate by this 👆
19/08/2018, 19:35 - +60 17-364 3269: I have already explained
19/08/2018, 19:38 - Eria Kamya: You said you never put besigye anywhere 🤷‍♂.
19/08/2018, 20:12 - +60 16-475 8556: true but he uses machineries like the sobi guys...give them police atires and they handle my dia they are deadly...had one driver of kitata saying the training kitata group have is even superior to that of our army guys....such pple were handling civilians imagine...those were the ironbars torture of bodaboda guys
19/08/2018, 20:14 - +60 16-475 8556: naye mwe singa muzeeyoko e ug two yrs back only that mwalitegedde  kyembagamba dats y sagala to reply someone lying to this group to avoid frictions here..
19/08/2018, 20:26 - +60 16-475 8556: wama bagambeko naawe nze wherever I speak my position towards some lies ngabagamba mbu control yo tongue gyooli eno group ya Mzee...mutufugire ewaka nemu group mubeemu engezigezi...nze sagala muuntu mulimba...just say banange things didn't go the way we expected and we r sorry dats enough no one is perfect naye nabasiiga akazigo...sagala kolima naye muli babi nyo bantu mwe...nze smtymz nsaba Katonda nabaana bamwe bayiteko mu mbeera yemu lwemulimanya...nokwaata mulekwa nemumukola byonna byemwagala.seems ezo ensiggo bamukasuse nga nagwa bubi if not gabadde gakonde oba maviivi mu mugongo  nga balinga abakuba ente endalu oba basezi babadde bagala kumulya simanyi? nemuwuba empale ku ma radio ne tv...era nio nio...kale mweyisa bubi bambi...mukama abasasire...
19/08/2018, 20:28 - +256 701 406572: <Media omitted>
19/08/2018, 20:31 - +60 16-475 8556: You will agree after reading and following all the steps and see what he has bn doing without m7 reacting...olaba tamale mirundi musajja wa mzee naye tatya nakukyogera nti Besigye akolera govt...kati ate gwe mugandawange...kirabika oludde nyo mu Malaysia...I may not blame you for that bro...but one day...olyewuunya ensi...
19/08/2018, 20:32 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣  bro controlling your tongue doesn't prevent you from putting your point across. It's just a social, self respect and respect for others issue.
19/08/2018, 20:32 - Eria Kamya: Hehehe kyekyo afande mwe muliko 💪💪💪
19/08/2018, 20:33 - +60 16-475 8556: I don't respect lies am sorry for that...
19/08/2018, 20:34 - +60 11-6111 5832: When 27 men went to the bush , they were the bad guys/rebels/force just like army man Kasirye Ggwanga is saying. They have did it and here are more than 30 years of ruling.
Why do they feel insulted when other people are doing without guns like they did.
They brought peace ,yes however intimidation and torture are not welcome in this modern world
19/08/2018, 20:34 - +256 701 406572: Newton's third Law in practise if you come with force will meet another equal and opposite force
19/08/2018, 20:39 - Eria Kamya: I hate it when Ugandans think that whatever tamale mirundi says has to be true. Is it because most Ugandans can't believe in themselves?  An occasional drunkard like tamale mirundi who just says random things is highly believed in. Why was he sacked from the state house?  Let's learn to analyse things on our own. We can't simply make other people to analyse things for us as if we never went to school. We also see things as they happen and try to analyse them.
19/08/2018, 20:40 - +60 17-631 2833: Smh🧐👀
19/08/2018, 20:44 - Eria Kamya: Did bobi come with force??
19/08/2018, 20:53 - Eria Kamya: What has besigye ever done and M7 never reacted? You know for us we have a saying, *ebilwa byelabilwa* literally meaning that as time passes certain things are totally forgotten.
20/08/2018, 01:52 - +256 701 406572: I would like to confirm that as a parliamentary commission, today,  I and my fellow commissioner Hon Arinaitwe Rwakajara sought an appointment with the Chief of Defence Forces to go and pay a courtesy visit to Hon Robert Kyagulanyi (Bobi Wine) and indeed we travelled with Hon Doreen Amule, chairperson of committee on Defence and Internal Affairs, Hon Ibrahim Kasozi and Hon Anita Among to Makindye Military Barracks.
Contrary to social media alarming reports that Hon Kyagulanyi is in dire state, we found him in a better state than what is painted on social media. Hon Kyagulanyi hugged and smiled at us, talked freely with us. He commended the UPDF doctors for taking good care of him medically. Am not shy to say that indeed he has a few bruises on his face but he is in good state. 
Indeed, he complained to us about his kidney and pain on his hip, but he confirmed to us that the doctors are going to do a scan to ascertain the exact problem.
Hon Kyagulanyi also requested that his children are allowed to come and see him and allow me confirm that on Tuesday, his children will visit him at his detention centre in Makindye. 
I appeal to the general public to desist from spreading alarming propaganda and false information about the health of Hon Kyagulanyi and Hon Francis Zaake who is also out of danger after he was put off the ICU. On 23rd August, the general public will be able to see Hon Kyagulanyi as he returns to Court.

20/08/2018, 06:47 - Eria Kamya: I am way better than those who have decided to make others their eyes, ears and brains when they have their own. I better trust my understanding first and just refer to theirs later. Many people think that when others write books they're the monopolists of the knowledge in that field. No way bro. 

What you should know is that I try to follow politics both locally, regionally and internationally. 

It could be because of my academic line but I don't easily subscribe to certain loose talks. I prefer practical evidence or a tangible example. Not just funny talks. 

If you are saying we have two govts in one, then be more clear about them. Otherwise you're only saying it because mirundi said so. In our country, there are certain things that have happened contrastingly to the "two govts in one" talk. Mirundi was chased from the state house because he was irrelevant there. Did he just resign?  No! And then you say his office is still there Hahaha. M7 apparently has what he needs to be in power. You recently *mboozi zamalwa*  and you're a die-hard fan of banywi. 🤣🤣🤣 Me I don't hate mirundi, whether he attacks mengo or not, (actually people recently were starting to attack mengo for their silence about what's happening now but mengo replied in a way they didn't expect) but he and others in political lime light are not the monopolists of knowledge. Me I believe in real-time analysis not historically-based analysis. 


When you say that politics is hard to analyse, I just have to laugh. Because why then did M7 abolish political education if it was so hard? 

The world keeps changing. Those days, no one would speak anything about mengo but now anyone can. And then you want me not to criticise mere individuals like mirundi? Leka naawe. 

And mind you bro, when you say that mirundi still works for mzee, then you're simply weakening your points. Because it simply means he's actually a biased analyst. Then you continue praising him. And you'll come to realise with time that most of the political analysts you watch on TVs are working for M7. And you make them analyse things for you? 🤷‍♂
20/08/2018, 08:23 - Eria Kamya: I heard many of your celebrated political analysts trying to analyse the presidential car issue. And all of their analysis was centred and focused on the photo. I totally saw no sense in their analysis. Of course there were many issues to discuss around the whole scenario. But many of them commented on the fact that the photo didn't have scattered glass pieces. As if they wanted the photo to be taken at the exact scene of crime and at the exact time given the chaos. Others about how the glass appeared to have been broken, etc And these are your analysts.

Good that he turned out to be the best performer. But the most important thing is to give someone a chance. That's when you'll know their true potential. Someone has always told me that there's no excuse for being late. But what I believe is that everything happens for a reason.
20/08/2018, 09:53 - Eria Kamya: I need an interpreted version because I didn't understand anything.

20/08/2018, 16:57 - Eria Kamya: Thank you for the link. I actually watched his last program before the Arua by-elections and had already watched some *clips* of this one before. Kaliisa is a good political analyst of course but his age is starting to weaken his political analysis. 

I will agree with him for just a few things, especially the local ones but let him leave the international issues to us. Those ones are beyond his analytical capacity. 
Back to our local issues, I couldn't stop laughing when he also tried to comment on the stoned car issue. And many other issues including the weak, unsustainable and false resolutions he gave the opposition. But let me not go through each of them. Of course I can't disagree with him in everything.

Let them accumulate assets, we'll sell them to pay some of the debts or to make government investments and boost our revenue/wealth for repayment of these debts. We can even nationalise their local assets 😅😅😅

22/08/2018, 14:06 - +60 16-475 8556: no sir I want you one day to say that white is white not black...
22/08/2018, 14:07 - +256 701 406572: Exactly. Mine is to defend Uganda as per constitutional obligations and not politics. I only comment against fake news tarnishing UPDF as an institution.
22/08/2018, 14:07 - Eria Kamya: Gen muntu told them to conduct themselves in a way that makes them safe when they're *out there*😅😅😅😅🤷‍♂
22/08/2018, 14:10 - Eria Kamya: Can you as well defend the recent brutal beating of journalists by updf soldiers?
22/08/2018, 14:12 - +256 701 406572: Exactly. The only proud thing i enjoy with UPDF is its professional attitude. We are like a family despite tribal or religious differences and we share common values such as respect for wanaichi, loyalty and courage
22/08/2018, 14:13 - +60 16-475 8556: no ur partisan everybody here knows it coz all along its not been updf..we understand you but me I just want you to be openminded...such that I can rely on you if I need facts not even defending togikwatako things thats not yo concern maybe those in parliament...I mean the soldiers...but yo always defending even what is naked...and I wonder my soldier..
22/08/2018, 14:13 - +256 701 406572: The UPDF leadership apologised as per today newspaper headlines and indisciplined soldiers are to be court martialled
22/08/2018, 14:16 - +60 16-475 8556: At least thats a nice lie you know...it can tame the public for peace and harmony...this time the lie is not naked...weldone👏🏿👏🏿
22/08/2018, 14:16 - Eria Kamya: I hope they're court martialled sir. Otherwise, it would be easier for them to court martial gen kayihura than these soldiers.
22/08/2018, 14:19 - +60 16-475 8556: where have you seen machineries being taken to court unless govt..collapses or when machinery identify revealed like kitata...the guy is working for the master and you say yo taking him to court for what...y do you think its still hard to take mr..Kayihura to court coz he had instructions from the big man...
22/08/2018, 14:21 - +60 16-475 8556: and mr Afande stop reading headlines search for the truth coz news papers are poison you know it more than me...
22/08/2018, 14:22 - Eria Kamya: I actually want afande to tell me whether the soldiers always deployed to calm riots are always having their names and numbers tagged on their uniforms.
22/08/2018, 14:25 - +60 16-475 8556: 🤣🤣🤣leave the man bro thats too hard unless you want him to kp absent for a month🤣🤣... hahaha...for today mr Afande we were prepared for you no ambushing us.

22/08/2018, 14:27 - +60 16-475 8556: Another lie here

22/08/2018, 14:43 - Eria Kamya: Am not saying he's also a machinery. But he's trying to convince us about the professionalism in the army. If the army was professional enough, they should have made the uniform nametags fixed. But those tags are removable and I have seen many remove them occasionally. Even the updf tag itself on the uniform is removable. Why did they do it that way in the first place? This was planned in the making of the uniform.
22/08/2018, 14:44 - +60 11-2895 6258: 😳😳😳
22/08/2018, 14:45 - Eria Kamya: This time they even had pliers and used them to hurt people on the police cars.
22/08/2018, 14:48 - +60 16-475 8556: Then we should blame the manufacturer who knew about the machinery activities coz imagine you can use someonez name who died in Somalia or Sudan...then after the dirty work on civilians you remove it...now for you searching for such a guy you end up to the grave 🤣🤣🤣🤣😀
22/08/2018, 14:53 - +60 16-475 8556: Mr Kamya oba madam Lydia ebiri e Uganda tabilaba🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂ nali nsubirayo eggulire lyona from her apartment from biri ebya Ug Hi Com..ate no abuze enaku zino oba twebuuze ku afande..simanyi oba ali mu field uganda asaka mawulire simanyi...🤷🏿‍♂omanyi bwana Kamya sikirungi kwerabira baantu nadala nga amawulire gaabwe gasanyusa afande waffe..😍
22/08/2018, 14:57 - Eria Kamya: And even those jackets they put on top of the uniform during riots hide their identities. Our Parliament should do something about this, so that every soldier or policeman has a big and clear number on their uniforms. Just as they keep telling boda boda cyclists to clear means of identification, even these security personnel should for so.
22/08/2018, 14:57 - Eria Kamya: Owaaye

22/08/2018, 16:40 - +256 701 406572: This was today at 1000AM when Deputy Speaker visited Hon Bobi wine. Now people saying he is on oxygen or badly off should start planning to sell other fake news. Truth travels slow than lies always
22/08/2018, 16:47 - Eria Kamya: His condition is not good at all.
22/08/2018, 16:48 - +60 17-364 3269: Yea the oxygen was definitely an. Exaggeration , but we still need to his health results , his smiling bse he can’t show his pain . But there is definite pain there
22/08/2018, 16:48 - +60 17-364 3269: I don’t know y u support something u can clearly see is wrong .

22/08/2018, 16:51 - Eria Kamya: A person in that sitting posture can't be good at all. He's using his hands on the table to support his hip/pelvic bones.
22/08/2018, 16:59 - +90 535 735 52 19: I think the person who took the video needs to buy a new phone and stop being so stupid, because Authenticity was very much required to clear the air 🤔

22/08/2018, 17:14 - +60 16-475 8556: Thanks for the video though...
22/08/2018, 17:19 - Eria Kamya: Some things don't actually need so much proof because they've been proved in many other subsequent scenarios. For instance, if the army can publicly beat up a clear journalist, who has a professional tag and camera, then these guys want us to believe that bobi wine wasn't tortured in their private military custody. 🤷‍♂
22/08/2018, 17:24 - +60 16-475 8556: ✌🏿👊🏿in military custody bandifuna ku nsonyi naye  in hotel room awo.haaa bakyekola okwaali nakatayimbwa though tekaali kamaanyi nyo just muwunza...

22/08/2018, 19:58 - +60 16-639 0643: He is purely NRM...no question abt that
22/08/2018, 20:00 - +60 17-364 3269: He is nrm
22/08/2018, 20:02 - Eria Kamya: If you observe bobi's video, you clearly see that he is two people in one. Otherwise what is that black thing around his back? The black thing actually continues down up to his left leg. Remember it's not a chair. He's sitting on a pink plastic chair. You can further see that as he bends his head forward-down, the neck and the t-shirt collar don't move together. Furthermore, as he bends his head forward-down, around the back of his neck you can see that another person's neck appears. 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂ you can review the video yourself.
22/08/2018, 20:02 - +60 11-2895 6258: Everyone has a right to support whoever they want so I personally don't see any problem with that.

22/08/2018, 20:08 - +60 17-364 3269: The problem is not who supports , the problem is supporting someone blindly that even wen they do something wrong u can’t see it . This can go both ways . By nrm n opposition . But the people who support people or parties blindly r worse than te people they support it the parties they support . Bse they r the ones who keep em in power

24/08/2018, 18:45 - +60 11-5359 0769: FACTS ABOUT ARUA STONE

Arua stone is found in Arua district, in the northern part of Uganda.

Arua stone is a unique stone different from any other hard core Stone ever known on the planet Earth. This must be out on record.
1. The stone is too hard more than a gun bullet to the extent that it can even smash a bullet proofed car at Presidential standards. This must be put to record.
2. This stone once thrown at the vehicle, it can by pass five other vehicles and hit only the vehicle intended by the smasher.
3. It is a magnetic stone that is capable of attracting and swallowing broken pieces of a bullet proofed car so don't expect to see any piece of your smashed car screen once it lands on your vehicle.
4. It can easily change dirrection according to side of the car it is aimed to smash. When it is thrown at the presidential convoy by a pedestrian from sides of the road, it changes direction and smashes the rare screen to invisible particals.
5. Once it is used, the vehicle multiplies it's self to many. This can be proved by the two different vehicles the presidential team normally posts after the incidence.
7. This stone is prohibited to use due to it's dangerous facts, once it is alleged to have been used, not even a honerable Member of Parliament can service brutal torture however innocent he may be. It is a treason case committed to be near this stone.
8. Since we have less to export as Uganda, out side countries can come and buy it for security purposes, since it is believed that not even a presidential jet can survive once this Arua stone is targeted to it. It is a natural weapon given to Uganda by God him self.

Having consolidated the practice of tribal biased recruitment and promotion, he proceeded to use the army against the Parliament, against the Constitution and against the people of Uganda. He even used it against his own political party. It was this tribal sectarian and unpoliticised army that eventually overthrew him and intensified the country's political crisis. Having overthrown the Constitution, Obote became a real dictator and used his illegally acquired powers to cover up his crimes. Many prominent Ugandans where subjected to detention without trial."```

26/08/2018, 05:58 - +256 701 406572: August 24, 2018. The President of the Republic of Uganda and Commander-In-Chief of Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces (UPDF), Gen Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, has today passed out 3958 soldiers who completed intake 15/17-18 basic military training at Kaweweta Recruits Training School, Nakaseke District.
While passing out the new soldiers, 136 of who were female, the President was impressed by the numbers and quality of the combatants most of who were University graduates that he referred to as a trainable force. He added that the qualities that the soldiers portrayed in the pass out demonstrations are a reflection of the bigger picture of the progress made in all sectors of security in the country.
Mr Museveni reechoed Kenyans Vice President’s recent comment that Uganda now exports more products to Kenya than Kenya exports to Uganda. The President emphasized that such progress and the wider developments Uganda is experiencing are as a result of peace and stability ushered in by a strong security system in the country.
President Museveni observed that the country has made great strides but it is still faced by three problems; political indiscipline, corruption, and crimes in the urban areas, although he noted that the government has already embarked on installing security cameras in Kampala as a measure to curb crime in the city and will handle all the other prevailing challenges.
He challenged the new soldiers to guard against reckless living in order to remain healthy to serve the country and follow in the path of their predecessors that liberated Uganda. He noted that the new soldiers had started their military journey on a historical ground from where the National Resistance Army launched important attacks such as that on Masindi. “You are on the footsteps of patriots and heroes,” President Museveni told the soldiers.
Meanwhile, the Chief of Defence Forces, Gen David Muhoozi, thanked the parents who gave in their children to serve in the UPDF and continue the struggle to ensure peace and security in the country. He welcomed the soldiers into the UPDF fraternity and reminded them that UPDF has always survived on ideological clarity, nationalism, patriotism, and strategic relationship with the people, hence making it a unique army on the continent. He implored the new soldiers to use what they have learnt to fit into the UPDF vision and mission in order to continue building a professional force.
In the same vein, the Commandant of the training school, Brig Charles Byaruhanga, advised the grandaunts to be ambassador of the UPDF throughout their service and to always remember that the UPDF values and mission, and loyalty to the country and their comrades, comes before their personal interests.
At the end of the function, the President awarded gifts to three students for their exceptional performance during training. The overall best student was RA/ 239011 PTE Bamusede Rodney, second overall RA/239700 PTE Kanuma Donald, and R/A 238797 PTE Abaro Brendah emerged the best in the field.
The function was attended by among others the Minister of State for Veteran Affairs Hon. Bright Rwamirama, the Joint Chief of Staff  Maj Gen Joseph Musanyufu, Commander Special Forces Brig Don Nabaasa, and the Chief of Personnel and Administration Brig George Igumba.

Frank tumwebaze, Ofwono Opondo, gen muhoozi, etc etc said bobi wine wasn't freed by the army court and that the charges for illegal possession of fire arms were just transferred to the civilian court on the request of the DPP. Now the DPP says they don't have charges related to illegal possession of fire arms in their report. Now who is fooling who? Who is confused?

It is buganda culture that sells buganda . It is buganda That forms the capital . It is buganda that that uganda is named after . It is Luganda that is widely spoken . I am very disappointed in u saying that central people have done nothing . Why is it that m7 refuses to give buganda federal . Bse all westerners will go back . M7 will not run forever . He will b removed . However am disappointed in this group for supporting tribalism . Westerners have contributed to country just like all other tribes have . No tribe is superior .

Jacqueline Wolfson is a name many Ugandans will not recognize. To those who have come across her in Kampala, they simply know her as Jackie, the muzungu woman trying to help street children through her NGO called “Shule Foundation” based in Kireka-Bweyogerere.

But beneath the philanthropic facade lies a calculating political operative, a front of powerful American lobby groups, whose sole focus now is to cause regime change in Uganda and possibly install a puppet leader. There are two key items on their agenda; homosexuality and oil.

On July 20th, 2018, Wolfson, who chooses to keep a low profile and tactically keeps a distance from her pet project, Bobi Wine, made perhaps the most public of admissions on what her exact mission is.

Under the guise of a charity concert at the Kampala Serena Hotel, Wolfson paid and invited renown South African musician, Yvonne Chaka Chaka, to grace a function which was a political unveiling of sorts for Bobi Wine.

At this concert, Chaka Chaka, who performed on stage with Bobi Wine, went on to describe him as “Africa’s new Mandela”, encouraging him to keep up the fight against Museveni’s dictatorship.

A few days later, at a Buganda Kingdom function, Bobi Wine deliberately posed for a photo reading Nelson Mandela’s autobiography, “Long Walk to Freedom”, to try and propagate an image that his handlers, coordinated by Wolfson, are hoping to cultivate and grow.

But just how does Wolfson and Bobi Wine intersect? In the political classic “Confessions of An Economic Hitman” John Perkins narrates how Western Political and Economic interests represented by their governments and companies hold third world countries hostage, exploiting their resources while controlling their politics.

Wolfson is an Economic Hitwoman. She is deeply rooted in the New York political and social fabric. A known LGBT campaigner and fundraiser for the Democratic Party back home, she describes herself as “self-made” entrepreneur who has made millions from the “concierge” business, a moniker for real estate business.

Whereas she had been in and out of Uganda severally, Wolfson in 2014 decided to set up permanent base in Uganda by starting her Shule Foundation. The timing was very telling. In December 2013, Uganda’s Parliament had passed the Anti-Homosexuality Act, drawing strong criticism from then Barack Obama administration.

Ugandans will recall an admission by President Museveni that the moment the Bill was passed, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had gotten on the phone, speaking for 45 minutes, where she basically read the riot act to Mr Museveni. The softer route thereafter was to use the country’s Constitutional Court to declare the law illegal.

The battle lines, however, had been drawn. The Western LGBT forces, that had been critical in propping the Obama government and had desperately tried to get Hillary Clinton elected his successor, knew it would be difficult to play ball with the Museveni government.

It is here that Wolfson comes in. In early 2014, just weeks after Uganda’s Parliament had passed the gays law, she settled in the country. Her mission, with the backing of deep-pocketed funders of the gays community, was simple. Find someone who can play ball.

It has been four years of meticulous research and planning by Wolfson. Being the astute strategist she is, she scanned the social and political landscape searching for an individual they could build as a political force.

At the height of the 2016 presidential elections in Uganda, her group briefly toyed with the idea of backing former Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi but were forced to retreat after the hastily crafted The Democratic Alliance collapsed. It was back to the boardroom.

However, on the sidelines, Wolfson had contracted Ann Whitehead, a Canadian trained communications consultant, to make contact with Bobi Wine.

A popular artiste, Bobi Wine, unlike most of his peers, had chosen to keep a critical stance on the government. And where his peers had dined with President Museveni, Bobi Wine had opted to keep close to Dr Kizza Besigye, a former ally of the President, turned his ardent critic who had run and lost in four presidential elections.

Bobi Wine fitted the bill Wolfson and Whitehead were looking for. A celebrity with brand recognition, a youthful face, no links to the country’s military past and already anchored as anti-government. Also, hailing from the populous Buganda tribe of Central region Uganda was a plus. On his part, Bobi Wine presented the ambition they wanted.

Bobi Wine also had one problem. In late 2013, he had taken to social media to attack homosexuals. Reality hit him hard when in early 2014 the UK rejected his visa request, citing his homophobic comments. He failed to travel for a series of planned concerts. Wolfson offered to help him make amends.

Theirs would be to fine-tune the rough edges, help him shed the gangster image, develop a coherent message that resonated largely with the youth, grow his social media presence, support his community initiatives, introduce him to important funders abroad and prepare him to launch a political push.

Those close to the two ladies and their other strategists say the plan earlier was to ensure Bobi Wine rides on Besigye’s back and launches a parliamentary bid in 2021.

The Kyadondo East by-election, however, presented an early chance to experiment on what they had been cooking. Taking on both the FDC and the NRM, Bobi Wine’s handlers have been keen to present him as a “third force”.

In the by-election, Wolfson and Whitehead insisted that Bobi Wine uses the national flag as his main insignia, in a bid to cut a nationalist figure. The victory seemed to come so easy and what has followed after is forcing them to rethink the entire timing of the Bobi Wine presidency project.

Whereas the initial plan was to have Bobi Wine run for Parliament in 2021 and angle for the presidency in 2026 (hoping President Museveni would be off the ballot), Wolfson and group are getting more convinced that Bobi Wine can actually run and win in 2021.

They are in overdrive. One of the immediate tasks was to introduce Bobi Wine to his new masters. That is how Bobi Wine’s sojourn at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University this February was organised.

It now turns out the short course was just a cover. Outside class, Bobi Wine was introduced to several wealthy sponsors of the gay community. Whereas Wolfson was in Mbale at the time, to divert possible links to Bobi, she had used her links to ensure Bobi Wine met and dined with some very wealthy LGBT sponsors.

Among those he met were officials of the New York LGBT National Chamber of Commerce, a powerful homosexual lobby in the US. These engagements besides familiarization offered Bobi Wine’s American masters a chance to size up the man they hope to use for their agenda in Uganda. The verdict seemed to be largely positive, considering what has happened since Bobi Wine returned from the US.

In Part 2 of these series, we shall explore in detail the planning of the Arua by-election debacle, how Museveni’s government was caught flat-footed, the use of Nairobi as a tactical base and how prominent activists were recruited to drive online traffic.

We shall also explore how the LGBT community has used their international media links to decampaign President Museveni and what seems to be the final onslaught against the Kampala regime, a move supposed to be led by an international law firm known for its public support for homosexuals.

Also, do not miss how the wider fight over Uganda’s oil is playing into this politics, and what concessions Bobi Wine must continue to make as he takes his central position as puppet-in-chief of his Western masters.
27/08/2018, 09:12 - +256 701 406572: 👆🏾from another fora I don't know how authentic it is but I found it to be an interesting theory so I decided to share 
Any thoughts on it ?
27/08/2018, 09:12 - +60 16-475 8556: mpz who kujikwatako were paid not even paid ..were guaranteed with sums of money to touch it still it govt...not citizens coz for us we elect you go give our opinions and make gd laws beneficial to us citizens not a group of pple...but reach there and change their minds...do u blame citizens still?
27/08/2018, 09:17 - +60 16-475 8556: homosexuality is there...only that its not publicised,...mzee is also a puppet...thats not news to me...but Afaande those guys come to a country that has its own  weaknesses...us we are tired of mzee before they came...even if its oil or what..who has bn benefiting from oil all along ?its mzee and his group...
27/08/2018, 09:19 - +60 16-475 8556: They drill oil everyday you think we don't know kati mwekwaasa Bobi wine...mzee Sam Kutesaaz buses were brought for the crude oil you think we don't know?...ezo story zamwe ffe tubakooye tetwetaaga kumanya.
27/08/2018, 09:24 - +256 755 911999: I didn't say citizens are the to blame for everything... I said we to an extent are to blame. But fighting corruption with corruption doesn't make sense. We as citizens should should not fuel the corruption. You must demand for services without necessarily having to pay. Look at a child whose parent sends them to buy airtime and a newspaper with 5000.... The kid reaches the shop buys airtime and a cheaper type of newspaper inorder to buy some sweets... This is the beginning of corruption. I know the government is to blame...I concur totally... But as citizens we have roles to play.
27/08/2018, 09:27 - +60 16-475 8556: no ezo story za Andrew mwenda nga bulojjo...ffe tubakooye...nejjetuli ebisiyagga gyebiri ababyagala gyebali temutunyumiza story namwe..no one wud welcome those pple if you served us well...for USA to steal oil is the same with yo govt no difference..they will steal and bank in U.S.A still

27/08/2018, 09:57 - +256 701 406572: I always post two opinions - those i think carry facts to help me and those i think are lies to learn lessons. I hate Andrew Mwenda articles more than you coz he just reacts to events. But dont ask me that why do you watch Man U games when you are Arsenal fan? Why post article you don't agree is like Arsenal fan watching Man U game
27/08/2018, 10:24 - +60 16-475 8556: 😅😅I thought they stress you like me...so to avoid stress I rather dump it...remember we are students.😅..much stress affects east n west you know it very well so we have to balance the two...🤷🏿‍♂✌🏿

28/08/2018, 08:08 - +60 16-475 8556: Mr...Kamya...lem tell you smthn...if you have no researched work...being super power is different from being hyper power...
28/08/2018, 08:08 - +60 17-364 3269: Kamya whoever owns Africa controls the world
28/08/2018, 08:08 - +60 17-364 3269: That’s y Europe does not let go of Africa
28/08/2018, 08:08 - +60 17-364 3269: N China has pushed its way into Africa
28/08/2018, 08:08 - +60 17-364 3269: Pls do ur research
28/08/2018, 08:09 - +60 17-364 3269: U need to have Africa to become a total super power .
28/08/2018, 08:09 - +60 17-364 3269: It’s the reason of colonisation
28/08/2018, 08:09 - +60 17-364 3269: African resources can help build armies
28/08/2018, 08:09 - Eria Kamya: You're using wrong measures
28/08/2018, 08:09 - +60 17-364 3269: Please do ur research
28/08/2018, 08:10 - +60 17-364 3269: Why do people want Africa . For wat ,??
28/08/2018, 08:10 - +60 16-475 8556: Three factors determine supremacy...money...media...defence and social life of people...
28/08/2018, 08:10 - +60 17-364 3269: Bse they need the resources
28/08/2018, 08:10 - +60 17-364 3269: Supremacy comes about as a result of powerful military
28/08/2018, 08:10 - Eria Kamya: The future is not about resources.
28/08/2018, 08:10 - +60 16-475 8556: walimundekedde nemuva kumu nga akatogo...

28/08/2018, 08:11 - +60 17-364 3269: Why do think Europe n USA keep stealing resources from all over the world
28/08/2018, 08:12 - +60 16-475 8556: today china and Russia are covering a wide range of media...not as before when USA was prominent
28/08/2018, 08:12 - Eria Kamya: @60173643269 do you see resources anywhere in the list? Though I haven't endorsed it 🤣🤣🤣🤣
28/08/2018, 08:12 - +60 16-475 8556: China is chasing USA from Asia...
28/08/2018, 08:13 - +60 16-475 8556: no resources are under money misa
28/08/2018, 08:13 - +60 17-364 3269: How is many gotten , how is supremacy created , how is the media influenced , how is a defence made , how is the social life of people made . Without resources
28/08/2018, 08:13 - Eria Kamya: In defence, China is the weakest @60164758556
28/08/2018, 08:15 - +60 17-364 3269: <Media omitted>
28/08/2018, 08:15 - +60 17-364 3269: <Media omitted>
28/08/2018, 08:15 - +60 17-364 3269: China is number 3
28/08/2018, 08:15 - +60 17-364 3269: Strongest military in the world
28/08/2018, 08:15 - +60 17-364 3269: I don’t know wat ur talking about
28/08/2018, 08:15 - Eria Kamya: I think let's first narrow down our list of the potential superpowers
28/08/2018, 08:16 - +60 16-475 8556: how kati anti wulira..if you have media just like usa had during Bush junior...you use it for propaganda...like sadam has deadly weapons and you attack him...Bin laden in Afghanistan and u attack...just bse you want to steal their oil...dats media...to convince other nations join you...
28/08/2018, 08:16 - Eria Kamya: By this we all agree that US is the super power
28/08/2018, 08:17 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes , but how did they build there media to the extent that had so much influence
28/08/2018, 08:17 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes USA is still super power but it won’t b for long
28/08/2018, 08:17 - +60 16-475 8556: this is true and india is no.4 UK is no.5...followed ny France...and Germany and so on
28/08/2018, 08:20 - +60 16-475 8556: Because Russia sold technology to other countries and apparently no one has monopoly over tech...when one makes a nuclear bomb..he becomes a super power and no one can attack you just simply...dats y after Gaddafi destroying his nuclear...he was attacked after two yrz coz he was no longer a threat
28/08/2018, 08:20 - Eria Kamya: It wouldn't be for long but Americans made a good choice of trump
28/08/2018, 08:20 - +60 16-475 8556: Money and monopolistic technology.
28/08/2018, 08:20 - +60 17-364 3269: Great so u have accepted
28/08/2018, 08:21 - +60 16-475 8556: 😅😅😅 Russia brought trump in power...
28/08/2018, 08:21 - +60 17-364 3269: And how did they get all that . U don’t understand . All this money the west he got from Africa . N now China wants a share
28/08/2018, 08:21 - +60 17-364 3269: Thank you
28/08/2018, 08:21 - Eria Kamya: Just that you didn't get what I meant
28/08/2018, 08:22 - +60 17-364 3269: Wat did u mean .
28/08/2018, 08:22 - +60 17-364 3269: Trump is controlled by putin
28/08/2018, 08:22 - +60 17-364 3269: America does not control Russia
28/08/2018, 08:22 - +60 17-364 3269: Russia controls instead
28/08/2018, 08:22 - +60 17-364 3269: Itself
28/08/2018, 08:22 - +60 16-475 8556: if you didn't know make research...that's y I said if you cannot protect yo vote then you cannot protect yo people and yo no longer a hyper power...
28/08/2018, 08:22 - Eria Kamya: What happened during the north Korea crisis?
28/08/2018, 08:23 - Eria Kamya: How?
28/08/2018, 08:24 - +60 16-475 8556: did I disagree with that?...as colonial masters that was it.
28/08/2018, 08:24 - +60 17-364 3269: Please make reasearch n follow American politics . U can watch shows like Stephen Colbert it’s a comedy show u will get all gist in a second
28/08/2018, 08:24 - Eria Kamya: America is rising again

28/08/2018, 08:25 - +60 17-364 3269: America is struggling getting respect
28/08/2018, 08:25 - +60 17-364 3269: Trump is not being respected by other leaders
28/08/2018, 08:25 - Eria Kamya: Someone didn't answer my question
28/08/2018, 08:25 - +60 17-364 3269: If ur a superpower n ur no longer feared or respected then there is a problem
28/08/2018, 08:25 - +60 17-364 3269: Wat qns
28/08/2018, 08:26 - Eria Kamya: About the north Korea crisis
28/08/2018, 08:27 - Eria Kamya: Who's nolonger respecting who?
28/08/2018, 08:28 - Eria Kamya: That was a time to test those who were calling themselves potential super powers
28/08/2018, 08:28 - +60 16-475 8556: Read the book called games of nationz...you will realise Russia controls USA...since they influenced the elections 90 percent...Russia and China control N.korea...USA controlled S.Korea..but its loosing it also....since N and S wana join again under one president.or leader
28/08/2018, 08:28 - +60 17-364 3269: North Korea was stopped by USA . Bse USA n North Korea have been enemies ever since. The beginning . But during Obama’s time . They had created some kind of relationship . Trump on the other hand , could fight North Korea . But he was not allowed by his country or even UN . So he had sort out the relationship of America n North Korea again .
28/08/2018, 08:28 - +60 17-364 3269: North Korea n America r enemies
28/08/2018, 08:28 - +60 17-364 3269: This is not the first time North Korea threatens USA
28/08/2018, 08:29 - +60 17-364 3269: If it was upto trump , they would fought . But there was too much pressure on him to negotiate n that’s wat he did
28/08/2018, 08:29 - +60 16-475 8556: he was hyper coz he controlled the world solely but now we have Russia controlling through many counterparts
28/08/2018, 08:30 - +60 17-364 3269: China can beat North Korea , it has done so in the past
28/08/2018, 08:30 - Eria Kamya: Good point!!! Why did they implement USA's sanctions on North Korea?
28/08/2018, 08:30 - +60 17-364 3269: The qns u ask . I already told u , no one respects trump . Not even Americans
28/08/2018, 08:31 - Eria Kamya: You don't know what you're talking about
28/08/2018, 08:31 - +60 17-364 3269: Bse USA has allies . And all it’s allies will implement that
28/08/2018, 08:31 - +60 17-364 3269: It’s u who is uniformed
28/08/2018, 08:32 - +60 17-364 3269: Trump is a laughing stock
28/08/2018, 08:32 - +60 17-364 3269: Make ur research

28/08/2018, 08:33 - +60 17-364 3269: In all the presidents of USA . Trump is a laughing stock
28/08/2018, 08:33 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
28/08/2018, 08:33 - +60 16-475 8556: pressure was created to save him lol thats politics...and created pressure to get money from japan and S.korea..which it got...USA could not go to war...has no money.my dia thats y Trump is stealing every where by using propaganda not gun...a business man can't go to war...that pressure was propaganda...
28/08/2018, 08:33 - +60 17-364 3269: Amin was feared
28/08/2018, 08:34 - +60 17-364 3269: Amin was feared . N Amin was a laughing stock after he died and only to people outside Uganda . In Uganda u could not laugh at him
28/08/2018, 08:35 - +60 16-475 8556: Games of nations...who told you Nkorea does not trade...even Ug gets there teer gas...
28/08/2018, 08:35 - +60 17-364 3269: 😂😂😂😂
28/08/2018, 08:35 - +60 17-364 3269: True
28/08/2018, 08:36 - Eria Kamya: Who was pressurising him?
28/08/2018, 08:37 - +60 17-364 3269: Did u follow
28/08/2018, 08:38 - +60 17-364 3269: The proceedings

28/08/2018, 08:39 - +60 16-475 8556: Bro...make research and follow their politics
28/08/2018, 08:40 - Eria Kamya: If someone wants to prove you're no longer a super power, why would they pressurise you to negotiate rather than fight?
28/08/2018, 08:40 - Eria Kamya: 😅😅😅😅😅
28/08/2018, 08:41 - +60 16-475 8556: himself through his allies...in the house...just for money bro and he fetched around 4billion dollars just from that.
28/08/2018, 08:41 - Eria Kamya: It would be better if you specify the allies
28/08/2018, 08:42 - +60 16-475 8556: and to negotiate with a weak country...meaning ur also weak to that level...
28/08/2018, 08:43 - Eria Kamya: Seriously dodging the question
28/08/2018, 08:43 - +60 16-475 8556: you want me to say Dickchin and all Republicans and some democrats..hehehe Bro...😅
28/08/2018, 08:44 - +60 16-475 8556: Which questions?
28/08/2018, 08:45 - Eria Kamya: When trump used strong and threatening words on North Korea, people said he was using a bad language. When he negotiates, he's weak to North Koreas level. Then what do you want? 🤷‍♂
28/08/2018, 08:45 - +60 16-475 8556: when they negotiated ..N.korea went back with 1M dollars...there's a chinese company in usa whose sanctions were removed...
28/08/2018, 08:46 - Eria Kamya: If someone wants to prove you're no longer a super power, why would they pressurise you to negotiate rather than fight?
28/08/2018, 08:46 - +60 16-475 8556: Dats politics remember...he was shouting but he knew he could not do anything...just  remote controlled by Putin
28/08/2018, 08:48 - Eria Kamya: Did you see any evacuation or resettlement scheme around Guam?
28/08/2018, 08:48 - +60 16-475 8556: Games of nations...coz they know you cannot do anything...and putin and Xi Ping were benefiting out of it...man this politics of these guys is puzzling if yo not a good follower.

29/08/2018, 12:43 - Eria Kamya: Uganda, like any other country has had many issues in the past. These have been mainly political, religious and cultural. It's not surprising that colonialism played a very big part in contributing to their continuity even up to many years to come. 

I may not go back to the detailed history but it's clear to us that certain privileges were given according to religious, traditional and political attributes. Since then we're treading along that track and it's seemingly worth of a concern. 

Recently I have carefully observed that for instance, the *Islamic community* in Uganda feels that they've not only been left out of serious government positions but also been targeted for criminal allegations and injustices. In fact, one Islamic religious leader warned moslems to avoid riots because it seems bullets are magnetically attracted to moslems. This carries a lot of meaning. 

Another group is also circulating posts on social media that it's only moslems (eg the shiekhs) that were not granted bail, but bigger suspects have been granted bail simply because they're not moslems. 

I then tried to look back into these issues and claims with my own interpretation and understanding. I remembered my little history about how Amin used to put moslems at the front of everything. I then wondered whether he was revenging past regimes and colonial effects in this issue. Now it's M7 and our brothers and sisters are feeling targeted. 

Besides religious lines, we have tribal lines and these are going to be another issue. And for this reason I feel pity for Bobi wine in one way or the other. Because according to me, the reason why M7 would rather die in power is because he (and his corrupt colleagues) has children and grandchildren. We recently heard what gen Elly Tumwiine said. It reminded me of what I think our Parliament should have focused on rather than the presidential terms and age limit lifting. What gen tumwiine said literally meant that they're not willing to give away power because they suspect revenge from the youth, *which revenge could turn out to be tribal*. And this points to a tough time ahead, with the president having threatened the electoral commission. 

These issues are very undesirable for our country. It hurts me when moslems feel targeted. In fact I don't know why they're always the first to be criminal candidates in any serious murders. I don't know what theory applies here even when investigations take long to be concluded. It as well hurts me to think about the impending tribal wars ahead. 

Therefore according to me, the only thing to avoid this is Parliament to start thinking about our future and what caused the apparent state. We need bills to unite us together as one country, with equal privileges regardless any religious, tribal or political attributes. The same bills should also be aimed at peaceful transitions, especially in ways that *safeguard presidents to a certain extent*.
29/08/2018, 13:47 - +60 16-475 8556: its wud be promising if everyone could comply with it...there so many incidences where such like tribalism..competit ion along religious lines...can be avoidable and not depending on how smone perceives the environment around..if yo govt.is controlled or supported by enemies of islam then yo prone to be one...as amin was being supported by Gadaffi and king of Saudi hence those were the outcomes. as he also faced tribalism from the Acholiz Langiz especially in the army...that time it was the nilotics and Hamites era...and so this time our govt.is controlled by U.S.A...UK..Netherlands..and German which engineers the NRM party...and all are war mongers who use militias moslem groups to kp insecurity around the world as they preach false islam you saw that in the ISIS..and with even non moslems joining the group spearheading the religion...whites operate on divide and rule tactics,insecurity,propaganda with media unfortunately our govt also does the same only failed in propaganda with media..and public relations...since moslems are targeted internationally,he uses the same phenomenon to disorganise them...true some were militants and suppoters of ADF but they surrendered to govt and came out and settled peacefully and due to mzeez unsatisfaction and disbelief he's not sure if they frankly surrendered...and so they started to eliminate one by one ever since the ADF guy was surrounded, up to prison..and so the elimination of moslems has never stopped...he fears them as they are aggressive during war just like impotent men..they fight through religious belief...(jana waiting for them...so don't fear death.its death that fears them😅).but point is unless all the listed moslems that were in ADF are wiped..killings of them won't stop easily it helps him to dicotyledonise,control and divert attention of people🤷🏿‍♂...for tribalism,I don't know but am sure he has failed coz if he puts a prominent person from a given tribe,all the assistants and secretaries are from his side..or from his family...but I think the only soln is to appoint only those with required qualifications especially the permanent secretaries...or promote intermarriages...this will at a given point reduce tribalism..and (or) promote nationalism coz here masses forget about tribalism..quotientise and focus on the nation at large.🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂
29/08/2018, 14:01 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣 naye musajja gwe what do impotent men do? 🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂. Intermarriages would also be of good solution to avoid future tribal wars. I also remembered what Mayiga said recently, that when Westerners are imprisoned they're not tortured but the rest are tortured. These are terrible seeds of tribalism much as it would be the case. 

I think we should treat Uganda uniquely so as to get out of this mess. We need to forget the past or pretend to have forgotten it. Otherwise we shall always pass on this hatred. And specifically to the current presidential mess, we need reuniting bills. Maybe we can make another new constitution after getting out of this crisis.
29/08/2018, 14:22 - +60 16-475 8556: impotent men fight one heartedly...you attack Bashir of N.Sudan you will realise that some wars are like the movies we watch...the impotent man has nothing to loose...will he miss happiness from a woman? no...does he have any child.? no...way...he can even attack you without making a daame...yo joking...🤷🏿‍♂
for westerners who are criminals treated like sons of chiefs at villages...it may not be tribalism...its inferiority complex..esp if his passport is indicating green..I don't know this generation fears and respects whatever whites put on table...then I wonder which breasts we fed on since our grt grand fathers were able to chase them out of our countries minus guns yt them had guns...really I don't understand where we inherited primitivity and  the backwardness..and its not only in Ug but also in Asia and Africa at large...what is in this white skin different from mine..🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂ we need sensitization..and take our kids to good schools...

29/08/2018, 14:39 - +60 16-475 8556: ohh I thought westerners you meant whites.😅😅😅 sry muko anti siri tribal...hahaha...me I was meaning whites like the other American guy who had artillery in his house..who mis treated our sister after impregnating her...it was a big issue in Ug...even the Pakistans who allegedly were reported for having raped their domestic assistant or worker...
29/08/2018, 14:41 - Eria Kamya: I meant Ugandan Westerners 🤣🤣🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂
29/08/2018, 14:46 - +60 16-475 8556: But if you mean our Bros the Banyakitara...then its too bad and just know abo most times baba bambegga...do you remember Win Byanyimas cozn who shot a northerna broad daylight? and he was granted bail....but if it was a muganda...northerna...or easterna hooo...ok...and thats y the Odonga otto opted to leave fdc bse of that incident...it was not fair...so tell me how revenge can be avoidable..unless you forgive and ignore...now that guy's kids are suffering...🤷🏿‍♂

29/08/2018, 14:56 - Eria Kamya: Kanyamunyu case was different. It was a normal case. I basically referred to cases that are linked to treason. And the person who raised this issue primarily referred to kayihura (among others) who was treated diplomatically yet the mps like bobi wine, nambooze, zaake etc were brutalised.
29/08/2018, 15:00 - +60 16-475 8556: How sure are you it's a point to Mr.X😅😅😅 enway joking but that goz to ministry of foreign and internal affairs...they are infiritrated now pple are making money out of it...now all policies have bn dimisfied..Everyone is after money...some one raised that issue before as it was happening in China...I remember and Afaande said he was to do research about it maybe fake news😅😅😅 then Eria replied smthn...😅
29/08/2018, 15:01 - Eria Kamya: What did Eria reply 🤔🤔🤷🏻‍♂
29/08/2018, 15:03 - +60 16-475 8556: ya but Kanyamunyo still it wasn't fair if u followed the whole story in Ug...and for Kaihura...it was fair bse he was operating on orders of smone...and that smone is above the law...so even if its me I would not agree to torcher him go for his boss.🤷🏿‍♂
29/08/2018, 15:05 - +60 16-475 8556: I remember he said even if you get to know...meaning what will Afaande do in his position...😅😅🤷🏿‍♂ thats how I perceived it..
29/08/2018, 15:20 - Eria Kamya: Still for kayihura it wasn't fair. If you say he was operating under orders of someone, then you're giving us inside stories which the court can't take in just like that. At that moment you don't know about any inside stories. He was the IGP so whose orders then?
29/08/2018, 15:29 - +60 17-631 2833: This time l need some one else's opinion plz not kamya or lhk plz
29/08/2018, 15:40 - +60 16-475 8556: hehehe court martial ajikulira si mujjasi?...who gives orders to him...its mzee...😅 and for ur info.mzee kayihura bateseeza butesa naye misango ki to put on him...hez mzeez boy🤷🏿‍♂
29/08/2018, 15:42 - Eria Kamya: Kayihura was heading police therefore he was handling police issues. So mzee was assumed to have no influence there. He gives orders in the army
29/08/2018, 15:42 - +60 16-475 8556: They had to release him...pple will not shout much since its bobi in media so to protect kaihura they had to release him immediately
29/08/2018, 15:46 - +60 16-475 8556: tebakulya sente...oli was ordered to demolish all political parties and everything...the police was politicised...mzee yenyini yakyogera lwaatu
29/08/2018, 16:03 - +60 16-475 8556: 😅😅😅 who appointed him? man mzee Kaihura is a carder...if yo a carder you do everything in favour of yo party and follow all orders of yo president..remember he is the commander in Chief...
29/08/2018, 16:23 - +60 16-475 8556: And apparently mzee has less support from his ministers remember all the letters(statements)on social media ..he wrote him self and was being given false info and apparently standing with just a few..so in this situation you cannot kp Kayihura in detention..what if sm thing happens he has to lead a division or battalion😅😅 naye mweeee...and for Bobi was just vomited by court martial before right time...even civilian court vomited him before even 30th..dats what we term as international pressure.from UK..USA(one member in house of USA okuva mu saaza lya California raised that Bobiwine issue..and forced mzee to release all the 34 guys and Bobi and Zaake have to fly to st.Marys hospital or the royal hospital in UK..🤷🏿‍♂ ..olaba ne Putin akoonamu who seldom interferes other countries politics...ngomanya ekiintu kya mukwanogwo  owakajanja kiyiika next year ayiinza obutamalako...and I told you this before..I told mi friend in crime preventers that this term is not gonna be easy for mzee after kwekyusiza Mbabazi yet they agreed it was Mbabazi for 2016..and mukulu Mbabazi left govt.teyakayana nga babye nobululu bwaafe...and ever since it started he has no peace. just we pray pple don't die many kuba I can smell enkuba yolutalo...I can see Nimbus clouds surrounding the sun..🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂...olaba ne Afaande waffe asirise ngomanya.heee🤷🏿‍♂
29/08/2018, 16:47 - Eria Kamya: Were you there when the orders were being issued to him? 🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂
29/08/2018, 16:58 - +60 16-475 8556: yiiiiyi naye naawe boss leka...do you need to be there when mzee is giving orders to the army?...its like asking were you there when yo mum was giving birth to you?...or when yo grand mum was delivering yo father?😅😅🤷🏿‍♂I expected a different question perhaps but that one is too hard though the simplest...😅🤷🏿‍♂...if you need such facts then you will never gt them...coz in the process you loose yo kichwa...😅 you die before...
29/08/2018, 17:11 - Eria Kamya: I didn't ask that question because of an answer. I just wanted to show you that it's not proper to just rush to conclusive statements of such nature.
29/08/2018, 17:14 - Eria Kamya: It's not only those who look for such facts that lose their kichwas, but also those who say out what they can't provide evidence for. 🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂
29/08/2018, 17:22 - +60 16-475 8556: 😅😅😅 but you man also assuming yo a Ugandan and you have bn in Ug...haven't ever heard of order from above when police chiefs sorround some prominent guy...gd thing mzee Kayihura is a carder of NRM and a soldier and mzee M7 is the coander in chief...where do soldiers get orders..lets be sincere and not make simple matters big...leka kinswaaza naawe...bino ebintu nkusubira okubanga obamanyi if you follow Ugandan politics...every Ugandan even in the ghetto known this now why not you?🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂ you don't need any evidence here kiri mu glass okilaba bulabi...🤔
29/08/2018, 17:29 - Eria Kamya: 🤣 when police guys cease someone eg besigye and say it's an order from above, does it mean it's M7? Is he the immediate person to think of? It could even be the KMP commander.
29/08/2018, 17:37 - +60 11-3637 6788: <Media omitted>
29/08/2018, 17:40 - +60 16-475 8556: so you have narrowed down to order from above😅😅..hes a colonel..and was face of opposition dats too big...apartfrom mzee...no one could order for accodation or capture apartfrom mzee y coz both are doing politics...gwe vva mumuzanyo naawe...ok currently who can order for Bobiwines arrest...apartfrom mzee and court? tell me...even for court he's briefed before...gwe bino bigyeemu amalala order from above is Mzee only here in  Ug...y coz he is the only above...he can't be arrested while still president....the rest...its corruption..tribalism which saves them...check kayihura...tinyefunza...besigye..mbabazi all have bn in custody apart from him...hes the only above in Ug...ate gwe nkumaze sikudamu bampe omulala😅😅
29/08/2018, 17:40 - +60 16-475 8556: Ebiki?🤷🏿‍♂

30/08/2018, 14:00 - +256 755 911999: Mwenda calls anyone that's not Muntu an extremist. Does Bobi wine have economic policies and strategies for Uganda now probably not ..does he have a manifesto probably not, does he have external economic policies and all those things??? Probably not....but at least he has heart for Ugandans...he knows what it means to grow up oppressed..he knows the pains of having to watch your neighbours die coz the facilities are inadequate...he knows how shitty the education system is... His been thru it... He is in touch plus I doubt Sevo had those things when he was going to the bush....we are not stupid... people are just angry... unfortunately their anger has been bottled up soon much right now they are demanding change....no one really has a plan they just want Sevo gone. Thank God we have Biraro n Muntu....we can combine their manifestos and also bring them in positions of leadership...all I know is Ugandans are done....
30/08/2018, 14:16 - +60 16-475 8556: 💪🏾💪🏾👍🏿me apparently I cannot waste mi time on mwenda whose brains werewere corrupted..he cannot differentiate between light and darkness..
he's blind..and deaf...

30/08/2018, 14:45 - +60 17-631 2833: I believe  besigye will work hand in hand with bobi

30/08/2018, 15:02 - +256 755 911999: I hope not... I hope Bobi works with Muntu and Biraro. With Bes the dude is sooo angry he's out to get the president...well they can share ideas and all but to be honest I feel like Bes n Sevo are the same coin....just different sides
30/08/2018, 15:06 - Eria Kamya: Me I just hope that the common cause is not affected by personalities.
30/08/2018, 15:26 - +60 16-475 8556: me what I know is...Besigye has bn balancing the equation with mzee though those of Bobiz didn't realise...so.but after discovering everything Bobi never walked away in an angry manner coz he needed Bedigyez pple...Besigye at least trained pple how to demonstrate...dats a tick and Bobi found it so easy upon  his nice mobilisation tactics...but trust me Besigye was shocked and terrorised by Bobiz rise since he waa the only getpass into becoming an issue as apposition in the country...Besigye broke the agreement they made from UK with Mbabazi as he(mbabazi) was to lead the TDA group...y bse he was working for m7 and was also greedy to be the "opposition president" recently he undermined Bobi that even if he standa for presidency the problem will remain coz he felt jealousy...hes just pretending but he doesn't like Bobi at any moment even he had refused him to stand for kyadondo east mp...all the Nambozez wanted millions to campaign for Bobi he refused to pay them and did it alone with a few...even the muntuz I don't trust them coz of their roots...they just want to represent batwatere embuundu...boys of mzee...maybe likes of Basalirwa... Zaake...Mwiiru..Win Kiiza and all those who have been with him in struggle...but Besigye no hes a snake apparently...
30/08/2018, 15:27 - Eria Kamya: Of course everyone was surprised by bobi's political rise
30/08/2018, 15:28 - +60 16-475 8556: and bobi is athreat to both NRM and Opposition..xoz aall have been there for yrs but being brainwashed by mzee and mw.Besigye...
30/08/2018, 15:29 - Eria Kamya: Then how does he become a threat to the opposition?
30/08/2018, 15:30 - +60 16-475 8556: but Bobi just one yr y music is a factor ...everyone knew him and hes young and from all kinds of standards...poor to wealthier...but mostly music enjoyed by mostly the youth who are the majority.
30/08/2018, 15:32 - +60 16-475 8556: if you ve bn cooking for yrs and ur man gets another woman with two weeks hes planning to marry her with a grt wedding...do you feel happy or angrier?🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂😅

30/08/2018, 22:26 - +60 11-5359 0769: I'm i might have not got u well... bt in my understanding, u r saying that  these mps shud not go for treatment abroad and fight for good health facilities wen they r in hospitals...

30/08/2018, 22:45 - +60 11-5359 0769: And the drs have always refered pipo regardless of there status..
30/08/2018, 22:46 - +256 755 911999: does not mean the y can afford it
30/08/2018, 22:46 - +256 755 911999: That's y you see those rallies... Manya 40/40.... golden heart
30/08/2018, 22:47 - +256 755 911999: How bout our government allocates some money to  R&D ???
30/08/2018, 22:47 - +60 11-5359 0769: U asked me wat we have been doing? Luk these pipo who take their daughters and wives abroad jst to give birth have drained the national treasury to the extent that they have destroyed these facilities
30/08/2018, 22:49 - +256 755 911999: My point... The more we go away for treatment the less motivated the hospitals are to step up...to improve their services....coz at the end of the day...pipo will be transferred...or they will die
30/08/2018, 22:50 - +60 11-5359 0769: So u want the poorly paid drs to use their money to buys the necessary equipments...
30/08/2018, 22:51 - +60 11-5359 0769: For ur info no drs wants to work on a patient and dies... bt if they dont have the necessary equipments, wat shud they do?
30/08/2018, 22:52 - +256 755 911999: No they should demand for better working equipment.....they have the platform now right???
30/08/2018, 22:54 - +256 755 911999: That platform has gotten pipo from allover the world getting together
30/08/2018, 22:54 - +256 755 911999: Let's start a go fund me page
30/08/2018, 22:54 - +256 755 911999: Buy machines

30/08/2018, 22:58 - +256 755 911999: It's like buying a car....asking as you can afford it
30/08/2018, 22:59 - +256 755 911999: The west appeals to us in forms of education, medicine, employment et al only to keep us in a certain place
31/08/2018, 03:59 - +60 16-475 8556: Bambino seemz you live in Europe..you talk like things shud be obvious...theoretically ur write but practically wrong...don't allow ur  theories mask the reality in our country...
31/08/2018, 04:18 - +60 16-475 8556: mi grand had an accident and was refered to Nsaambya but she could not make it till she was taken to UK and doctors there stated they would imprison the nsambya doctors for having operated the old woman that way...they operated her as if she was dead already you know..somethings we need to analyse the situation.pliz not a matter of politics..With life..its different....yo 100/right but you cannot do that whn yo so sick esp.Zaake..you need to have enough energy and campaign coz its a heavy load...
31/08/2018, 04:35 - +60 16-475 8556: Bambino dis time we are not at pa...coz yo sinario is like you want Bobi and hon.Zaake who are yet to seat for an exam in the afternoon and you want them to revise all the 35 topics.(1986 to 2018) just in few hours to the exam where evn colonel Besigye failed to advocate for such all yrs and Bambino wants the young boys to do so despite the injuries they have...at least they showed us that we can...pple power...let's appreciate that...its all our mandate..not them only...ok? today its Zaake and tomorrow its yo dad...
31/08/2018, 04:44 - +60 16-475 8556: imagine those boys were injected with poison which penetrates yo system gradually...we may have doctors but do you think we have machines or devices and enough skills to diffuse out all the poisons from the body? and are not the common ones...please Bambino lets consider as many factors and dimensions...assuming its yo life...what can you do...its only parents who sacrifice their lives and wellbeing for us even if things are tight on them...its only yo mum who can accept the worst to her privacy just to save her beautiful gal..🤷🏿‍♂
31/08/2018, 04:50 - +60 16-475 8556: This is a national issue which involves all of us...they were arrested bse they know they have much info to give to whites and you will see many guys being arrested or banned from moving around the world..and two to waste their time just political games maybe they want to pass smthn...you every game is calculated  my dia.
31/08/2018, 05:04 - +60 16-475 8556: and remember the  international community call them whites are behind us or Bobi so thats the issue now...NRM no longer has a simple enemy...its a big one now its the west through us...as we've tried to show concern internationally...note that please...
31/08/2018, 05:28 - +256 755 911999: Goodmorning brethren
31/08/2018, 05:29 - +60 16-475 8556: Morning
31/08/2018, 05:42 - +60 17-631 2833: Good morning to you all
31/08/2018, 05:42 - +256 755 911999: I stand by what I am saying..I think if the elite of this country continue to seek services out of Uganda the services in Uganda will never improve. Bobi has a perfect platform right now so many pipo are intrigued by what's happening to him...many know that most of our hospitals are shit....this is the perfect time to really show this. This could catapult change but going to get these services abroad just  shows he is like the people he has been singing about.. I am so sorry about your grandmother....but after attaining the above information did u take action with the Ugandan hospital???or since she was worked on by whites it automatically made everything okay? Never trust neighbours who come into your home and try to solve your problems....half that time they have hidden agendas. That said how about those who can't afford to leave the country or can't afford treatment out there??? See recently Bebe gave 60mil if he had invested that money in the medical sector wouldn't it make more sense??? Shall he have a concert to perform for every 10 children with heart murmurs?? Everyday we see car washes...money collected to send pipo abroad how bout we channel that money in correcting what is wrong with hospitals so that everyone can access these services?? As for the doctors I am sure we have doctors....and if we don't we can send some to  do residencies in various countries...India the UK etc or better still we can hire doctors as expatriates..they come here 2 years switch up the system...teach our doctors and go.. what am saying is let this people power be for all people not just afew
31/08/2018, 05:42 - +60 16-475 8556: we all equal but what matters is ur contribution to the country...and we cannot be equal despite what dats y we have the rich...average and poor..if we were all equal then the world would be meaningless...you can see that even in the bible old testament women were just a special property of man and are not talked about and not even counted in number..apartfrom Deborah Esther cos were prophets...then you want  slaves to be equivalent to a king? no way mi dia...its the opposite...we are different interms of intelligence..attitude ...belief..faith ..perception...status...and that classifies us...don't expect king of Buganda to be treated like you mi dia...I told you yo reasoning has a vigor and religious but you have to face the reality...avoid the blind faith
31/08/2018, 05:48 - +60 16-475 8556: This is regime change...don't expect anything new from a 35yr old govt...all yrs they never planned for popn growth....and all that...check roads not more than 20/ contructed compared to obotes and Amins roads...even with in govt sm clicks are against any kind of achievement by NRM...just face the reality mi dia..🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂
31/08/2018, 05:50 - +256 755 911999: Lol atop of having her own BN medics, the queen of England actually uses normal medical facilities in her country...just that when she is there sections of the hospital will be cordoned off...which us normal she's royal I mean... Services should not segregate...just coz one us poor doesn't mean they should not access decent health care...or education or services...
31/08/2018, 05:55 - +60 16-475 8556: hmm of course you have to show pple that you get average health services..in order to bring them together but you don't know whats behind the walls...
31/08/2018, 05:55 - +256 755 911999: Continuing to face the reality is what keeps us behind so to speak.... Self pity,n lack of self trust, you don't see Americans coming to Uganda to study.....they always come to help... Poor Ugandans always needing the help of Americans or Brits... If you keep carrying a child even one who can walk properly they will always want to be carried.... You better set them down...let them walk..they will fall down,get bruised but they must stand up and walk again
31/08/2018, 06:02 - +60 16-475 8556: we all matter but what matters is yo contribution  to or efforts from the society...don't....lem give you a phenomena....if a rich Muslim man with four daughters all sick goz to Nsaambya or Lubaga a Catholic hospital and a poor Catholic man with his four daughters all sick....who will be catered for first with adequate care and standard? and are humans of God....always face the reality not only reasoning...coz minus reality you fall out of the race.
31/08/2018, 06:03 - +256 755 911999: Did you see where I mentioned that services should not segregate??? We are humans first and foremost... Before anything else and that's the basis on which we should attaining services.
31/08/2018, 06:06 - +60 16-475 8556: hmm..alright but if you are attacked by thieves in yo steads y do you call neighbours...to help you chase them away...or catch.them...assuming these thieves have guns just like our govt..and you fear to die can you fight them minus yo neighbours helping you...enway me I like to face the  reality coz I don't believe in dreams...
31/08/2018, 06:09 - +256 755 911999: I do not mean next door neighbours bruv... although even those ones you can never be sure...wat if they are the ones who contracted the thieves?
31/08/2018, 06:10 - +256 755 911999: I guess  this is why people are encouraged to take self defense classes
31/08/2018, 06:11 - +256 755 911999: We can agree to disagree...no problem there.... Please ps...Bobi was denied access so since the world is standing with us....how bout some doctors come to him...
31/08/2018, 06:12 - +60 16-475 8556: Of course we are humans but do you think we can be equal...check what you study and what I study very different so they make us different only when me and come together and we align the two programmes then we get the best out of it all...otherwise if we were all presidents then I wonder who would be the tax payers...we can never be the same...mi dia face the reality...🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂
31/08/2018, 06:13 - +60 16-475 8556: And how many have spared time for it? How many can afford it and after those studies are given a gun to defend yo self from gun men...face the reality still...and I stand by that...🤷🏿‍♂
31/08/2018, 06:15 - +256 755 911999: Does that mean I shouldn't receive treatment?? because I am not equal??? My dear at the end of the day the same blood that runs through the veins of Sevo is the same blood type that runs thru the veins of some guy deep in karamoja....I think we ought to access decent medical services regardless of being a president or not. After all the president the rich the elite they all come from among the population.... They don't fall from heaven

31/08/2018, 06:42 - +60 17-364 3269: How is this proven that his dead
31/08/2018, 06:52 - +256 701 406572: At least you have mentioned one good poin today. There is no indegenous opposition growth in Uganda. Bobi, Besigye are all pumped by some rich individuals in the West to destabilise our country. Ofcourse they target resources and NGO jobs if situation worsens like now in Libya. Both Bobi and Zaake are just faking. True they were beaten during arrest but all scans and clinical evidence shows no damage. Whom are they fooling? Bobi in his house walks well alone without support but publically, puts on different picture. But foreign intervetion is always disaster and we shall never allow this. We should determine our own fate, be treated in our own hospitals and buy what we produce. running to States everytime just to report is what made Zimbabwean hate Morgan Tsangarare.
31/08/2018, 06:54 - +256 701 406572: Fake news and Ugandans are now learning how to copy up with these fake news like fake products
31/08/2018, 06:57 - +60 17-631 2833: They asked them to bring him out among all his no were to be seen since
31/08/2018, 06:57 - +60 17-631 2833: David this is not fake news
31/08/2018, 06:58 - +256 755 911999: Mr Watasa let's not down play people's pain. It's sad to hear you say that people who are visibly hurting are faking it. We all know these guys were beaten like no tomorrow....a thing people in power are distancing themselves from yet they did it...
31/08/2018, 06:59 - +256 755 911999: If you can hit your small toe and that just disorganises your whole day how about the beatingd those guys received
31/08/2018, 07:01 - +60 17-631 2833: Ok plz tell us if you got news of where they are plz tell us

31/08/2018, 07:14 - +60 17-364 3269: Hmmmm Watasa I have come to believe that u have a problem . Bobi or no bobi . How do u support wat this govt is doing to people . Surely they beat them but not that much . So ur saying it’s ok to torture . Ur saying bobi is backed by the west . M7 was backed by the west wen he fought Obote 2 n they loved working with him until he turned on em . U talk about bobi heAlth as being faked , wen parliament full of ur people admitted that he had been hurt even the speaker olanya who is a m7 supporter admitted it . But wait ur test shows he is fine . The one u did to him . U dare talk about but wat we produce . Wat does uganda produce wen Indian n Chinese companies r put b4 Ugandan companies. We entirely depend on imports . Bse if ur govt . Bobi is being backed by the west bse that’s wat they do . They back both bobi n m7 whoever wins is who they go with . am sorry . But me Watasa ur abroad n u have better resources now that ur hear . Why not go back n study from makerere , or work at Uganda house . Why come here Instead . U very very well the situation in ug n u still refuse to accept it . People like u r more dangerous than m7 bse u keep him in power
31/08/2018, 07:16 - +60 17-364 3269: Bobi has always been there for people even b4 white people knew his name
31/08/2018, 07:16 - +60 17-364 3269: We all know whites r users
31/08/2018, 07:16 - +60 16-475 8556: 😅😅😅😅 madam that's our Afaande mujaasi..😅😅 you don't need to quit he likes ur views naffe tumumanyi he's NRM but it doesn't mean he doesn't like us...he has his points he sees are better and some of us have ours we think are the best...we are all Ugandanz and due to democracy you have to accept his views as he also listenz to ur views...its how play design and tray them for us...you don't need to quit😅😅😅 this is home...and not only him...others like NRM just opted to keep quiet...🤷🏿‍♂...hahaha I love this group...but don't worry we shall handle Afaande we are many😅😅💪🏾💪🏾 with good democratic views...
31/08/2018, 07:19 - +60 17-364 3269: Today ur going to block me . So wat ur saying is that we should not speak our minds that means we should not say anything that might hurt him bse he is out Afaande . So we should suffer in silence . Just like wat m7 is doing to us . This African culture were elders can do anything to young ones n young ones r not expected to talk back is why most of the elders have disappointed us
31/08/2018, 07:21 - +60 17-631 2833: Your right no say at all even if you say it's not considered

31/08/2018, 07:27 - +256 755 911999: I really feel what your saying.... It is disappointing to see a person in uniform a person who should be protecting the people turn around and say they are faking it. If Bobi isn't such a thorn in your side y must the government treat him with such malice, they've threatened people on social media, kidnapped people tortured them and then you come here and say they are faking it....come on bro...

31/08/2018, 08:56 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes , most Ugandan girls come here for prostitution . But who brings them here . It’s Ugandans themselves , who buys them . It’s those Nigerians bse they like Ugandan things . Nigerians have no right to judge anyone . They r most criminals here . The point I was making is that u said wen u r a criminal u face the law . U said it in a way without any sensitivity at all . Wat about those girls that r brought here thinking there r going to work normally yet they r brought here for prostitution n they r caught . Wat has the embassy done about that . Wat about students who end selling themselves to get money . For their Tution n study materials . They didn’t come here with an intention to sell themselves . They came here to study just like Chinese n Malay prostitutes who r students . These things happen but the embassy does nothing for these girls . Wat u said was insensitive .

31/08/2018, 09:16 - +60 16-475 8556: hmmm how insensitive is it? trust...me we all know prostitution is a criminal whether yo ignorant of the law or not...our ugandan commission can not help you out with financial matters unless yo govt sponsored student..y bse you came here on yo own...if you do crime to complete yo tuition....its good for tuition but yo breaking the law...don't think our commission will help you...just play smart and move on...avoid risk places where you can be caught...make friends here esp.Ugandans...who will help you out.....Now Evie in ug itself prostitutes are so many and govt has done nothing about them...do you think they will help those who were able even to fly abroad despite the associations or groups which bring some here...Please think and think.
31/08/2018, 09:16 - +60 17-364 3269: 😂😂 mulinde akomewo
31/08/2018, 09:17 - +60 17-631 2833: I expect more views form  deferent plp
31/08/2018, 09:17 - +60 17-364 3269: I didn’t ask them to help them finically . I want them to help  them legally .
31/08/2018, 09:18 - +60 17-631 2833: Eve your right
31/08/2018, 09:18 - +60 17-631 2833: I'm with you dear on this point
31/08/2018, 09:21 - +60 16-475 8556: enway lem deserve my content coz kirabika abamu mulina nebyeejjo...you want equal rights yt yo a foreigner...go to Qatar or Saudi obikolereyo ebyo byogamba olabe...thi is not Europe..where most ppl are educated...and understand noo..enway thats yo perception and mine is different..maybe...🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂
31/08/2018, 09:21 - +60 17-364 3269: In law . Just bse u commit a crime it does not make u necessarily guilty  legally . There is such a thing as a defence . And when u have one . You should b put on the floor n heard . N if ur defence makes sense they let u go . That’s y most people say lawyers r lairs . Bse it’s possible to get a defence for some of these girls . Who r taken advatage  of. . Most embassies of other countries do that . They help there people legally . If they r in trouble even if they r guilty . They r part of ur country . Atleast of the country will request for them to b transferred to Ugandan prison especially those that get life imprisonment
31/08/2018, 09:23 - +60 17-364 3269: We don’t want equal rights as the Malays . But out country owes us a duty to protect us , when it has to . So if the country can’t help u wen ur having a problem when will it help u .
31/08/2018, 09:24 - +60 17-364 3269: My problem is not with malaysia , my problem is that our embassy does nothing . That’s it .
31/08/2018, 09:28 - +60 17-364 3269: These Malay schools come to uganda to advertise there sources . N the giver let’s them do so . They don’t do any kind of agreement on how we get protected in this country . A police can ask u for money n u have to give him bse if u don’t u will b in trouble n they know ur country won’t help u . That’s y they ask Africans for bribes mostly . Bse they know we don’t have anywhere to report
31/08/2018, 09:28 - +60 16-475 8556: its not only prostitution...and what of guys with njagga...naye mwe ebiintu mubilaba mungeri ndala nnyo...now law enforcers caught you and yo guilty how can embassy really help you legally if not financially and who told you to engage in that business pliz law is law...if you know yo job is kind of crime...you shud have backups or friends like the njagga  boys...they have stafff to work on other than fighting for you legally...what if you are around 200pple...how can you defend all those? naye mweeeee....
31/08/2018, 09:29 - +60 17-364 3269: Wen irene was caught with drugs didn’t the embassy help her in China to get her out
31/08/2018, 09:30 - +60 17-364 3269: This is the problem with Africa . In USA where people commit real scary crimes . USA will always fight for there people . They will get her out of the country bring her home . Then punish her from home .
31/08/2018, 09:30 - +60 17-364 3269: But atleast they got her out
31/08/2018, 09:30 - +60 17-364 3269: That is wat build patriotism .
31/08/2018, 09:31 - +60 16-475 8556: 🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂ then call upon the admz we write a statement to the embassy or commission and inform them what's happening on ground maybe they are not aware?😁😁🤷🏿‍♂
31/08/2018, 09:32 - +60 17-364 3269: Wen u do something bad at school , ur parent will come n ask the teacher on ur behalf to forgive u . Not to suspend u . Then wen u reach home . U get it chibox . But wen u will still go to school tomorrow . A country is supposed to help her own no matter wat .
31/08/2018, 09:32 - +60 17-364 3269: Then purnish u later
31/08/2018, 09:32 - +60 16-475 8556: soln is to change govt dats it and its ur power now...I think this time no rigging or no voting....🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂

31/08/2018, 09:38 - +60 16-475 8556: eyo ndowozayo nga gwe but that's not the reality...a law is a law...when an English artist was caught with njagga or cocain in china ..England pleaded but the guy was killed and the friend life sentence..y law is law...and just imagine the influence of England...yo joking...mubikole nga mumazze kuwandiika daame😁 oba nga you have sm rich friends here otherwise just gt back home oyiiye nakatono kofunyeewo.🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂
31/08/2018, 09:39 - +256 755 911999: Atteh even some of those ones have hidden agendas
31/08/2018, 09:41 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes , but that does not happen all the time. Reality is that they get more people with drugs but they get them out . I do English law n I have studied so many cases on drugs n English people . By the time they killed that one . It was too much . But atleast England tried to get him out . THAT IS MY POINT . Try n fail but don’t fail to try . Uganda does not try at all
31/08/2018, 09:41 - +60 16-475 8556: and bse she was just blackmailed coz she didn't go with it at airport basooka kunonyereza mummy

31/08/2018, 09:43 - +60 17-364 3269: I do law . N the best defence of drugs is it does not belong to me . Especially if ur a user . Not a transporter . U can Easley deny it . Especially if u have not used it in some time
31/08/2018, 09:45 - +60 17-364 3269: IHK MY PROBLEM WITH THE EMBASSY IS THEY DONT TRY AT ALL . U see , ur telling me that I go to bbc to check the story . A man who is a criminal made news on bbc . Bse uk failed to get him out . N yet in ug many people suffer n I does. Not make news at all . Bse the govt does not care
31/08/2018, 09:46 - +60 17-364 3269: People in Arab countries r suffering
31/08/2018, 09:46 - +60 17-364 3269: Only a few channels get this information n try to talk about it
31/08/2018, 09:47 - +60 17-364 3269: But sure if u can’t see that there is something with uganda n how the country does not take care of its own
31/08/2018, 09:47 - +60 17-364 3269: I don’t know wat else to tell u
31/08/2018, 09:47 - +60 17-364 3269: Something wrong

31/08/2018, 09:50 - +60 17-364 3269: Bse u were brought up in country that does that . But other countries wen u commit a crime on foreign soil . N ur guilty . They will plead with the country to transfer u to the country of origin so u serve the sentence at home .
31/08/2018, 09:50 - +60 17-364 3269: Ur still getting punished ur just serving it alone
31/08/2018, 09:50 - +60 17-364 3269: At home
31/08/2018, 09:51 - +60 17-364 3269: I told u it’s different to b locked up on foreign soil

31/08/2018, 09:52 - +60 17-631 2833: IHK you will arest an innocent person coz your following orders so if they order you to kill you do so hhhmm
31/08/2018, 09:53 - +60 16-475 8556: if you know yo kid is hungry y do you pass next or near kiosks with donats...if we know our govt policies then lets try to avoid some scenarios
31/08/2018, 09:54 - Eria Kamya: Great views we've got here, but much as I am happy for the unusual contributions, I am greatly disappointed in some of you.
31/08/2018, 09:54 - +60 17-631 2833: How will you do that when you can't even reason right for once
31/08/2018, 09:54 - +60 16-475 8556: gwe naawe tomanyi byamajje me I kill you order is order...ate siwozesebwa mu court coz it was an order and I was under it...

31/08/2018, 09:55 - +60 16-475 8556: awo amaggye gaba gakulemye ngogavaamu
31/08/2018, 09:56 - +60 17-364 3269: Wat kind of nonsense is this . This is wat I tell u . It’s like u don’t understand wat is happening . So in other words . We should continue paying bribes to the Malay police even wen u have documents . In other words they should continue to take us for granted n b racists even wen u have done nothing then . In otherwise we should live in fear just to survive . This is most cowardice thing u have said
31/08/2018, 09:59 - +60 16-475 8556: what kind of nonsense🤔🤔🤔 hahaha neyanziiza mukyaala loooya...eeeh hmm naye ba looyaaaa... lem deserve it....I don't want it  affect you en way...🤷🏿‍♂
31/08/2018, 09:59 - +60 17-364 3269: This is the cowardice that is wrong with African people . We accept oppression

31/08/2018, 10:00 - +60 17-364 3269: 😂😂😂 am sorry . It’s just u don’t get it . A nation has a duty to care for her own . A nation is your mother . Ur mother should take care of u . N if she does not u end up hating her .
31/08/2018, 10:01 - +60 17-364 3269: For failing to do so

31/08/2018, 10:02 - +60 16-475 8556: I wish you could read and analyse smones sentence before judging it being nonsense..some of us like giving examples to bring out a clear meaning...of our statement...hmm..ok maybe lem look for a sensible example..perhaps it may not be nosense to you😁😁🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂
31/08/2018, 10:02 - +60 17-364 3269: <Media omitted>
31/08/2018, 10:04 - +60 17-364 3269: Ur one example does make all . U gave me an example of a English man who was killed . N I told u . Every year they keep getting English people trafficking drugs in China . But uk manages to get them out . Let me google for the statistics . But that one person was a very big loss to uk , even if he was a criminal that’s y the news made it on bbc . But Ugandans get in trouble n we r not a loss to anyone but our famil members
31/08/2018, 10:05 - +60 17-364 3269: That’s the point . N u say avoid certain things . That is easily as saying accept oppression , both by the Ugandan govt n Malay govt .
31/08/2018, 10:07 - +60 17-364 3269: The only reason people go to these kind of jobs is bse of oppression by Ugandan govt n now us who r not doing those jobs we still oppressed by malay govt . But we should just accept it . Right .

31/08/2018, 10:17 - +60 17-364 3269: I like the last point
31/08/2018, 10:17 - +60 17-364 3269: We become a family n help each other
31/08/2018, 10:17 - +60 17-364 3269: Now that’s a good point
31/08/2018, 10:18 - +60 17-364 3269: Kuba embassy if it was not doing it then the chances of the doing it now r very low unless we change our govt
31/08/2018, 10:18 - +60 17-364 3269: Mayb they can change the policies as well
31/08/2018, 10:21 - +60 16-475 8556: Nyabo  first go for orientation about me...then you place me in any category of Ugandan kuba tontegeera...mpulira nga nfuna kamunguluze whenever you put me where I don't fit.

31/08/2018, 10:35 - +60 16-475 8556: no I think zimbabwe togyitegeera bulungi...it was China eyagyako mugabe not them...in them they even had some firing (fights) dats when china came in....and China was doing it for Trump in exchange or removal of sunctionz from one of chinaz company in USA..and .good enough he was too old..so mugabez men are the ones in power dats y they never jailed him..only that mugabe wanted to give power to pple of his wifes tribe who wud turn against the army guys who built zimbabwe..and even don't want whites come back to claim land and farmz which they got by force from them..and in Trumps manifesto he promised.to remove Mugabe and M7 so everything is timed...mugabe ia down m7 at the edge....smthings are analytical not as you see them openly no...so its still mugaabes men in power that's y they even rigged or forced them selves to be president just like mugabe did and still sanctioned...no change whatsoever..and apparently Ugandans tukkoyee abanamagye otufugga twagala civilian like Bobi or Basalirwa or winnie Kiiza...abanamagye needa tukooye...👋🏾

31/08/2018, 11:32 - +60 17-364 3269: Put all aside . That is u looking for excuses . The zimb army stood for the people . They had every choice to fight on behalf of mugabe but they didn’t . They stood for the people

31/08/2018, 14:18 - +256 701 406572: I try always to respect other people's opinions even if they differ from mine coz its foundation of democratic system of governance. I took an oath to obey the laws of my C-in-C even if it means paying with my blood. Every leader has the mandate entrusted by citizens to serve for a specified period and in 2021, Ugandans will have a say in that mandate. The role of security apparatus is to ensure that a small section of people doesnot hijack people's power to disrupt that  mandate. Uam sorry  if i hurt others opinion
31/08/2018, 14:23 - +60 16-475 8556: This is the soldier I know now not the other one of NRM😅😅...but still the small group have to be catered for as wel coz they could be having burning opinions or issues that need immediate response so if they come out and demonstrate..don't just beat up like yo beating a snake just as you did recently to an "Algerzeelah" journalist.🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂
31/08/2018, 14:24 - Eria Kamya: Afande no worries. Don't succumb to pressure and criticism here. We all know what it means to be in the army. It's about orders. Those who don't want to understand your situation leave them. You could even be tracked by your bosses on your phone, who knows 🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂

However if you have any good and objective opinions we always welcome them. Some people here mix emotions with issues. Let's understand each other clearly, respectfully and with due consideration.
31/08/2018, 14:25 - +60 16-475 8556: The army lost fame and it's respect for ppl..they tried to bring it back in court marshals staff but still need more than that....🤷🏿‍♂
31/08/2018, 14:26 - +256 755 911999: Isn't this ironic tho??? because the small group of people back in 85 took to the bush to fight.... For the Uganda today so y is it that now when history is about to repeat itself all over sudden it becomes a problem?
31/08/2018, 14:26 - Eria Kamya: So you also want us to go to the bush like they did?
31/08/2018, 14:27 - +256 755 911999: No I want us to avoid that route by allowing people to express themselves instead of muffling their voices with excessive torture.
31/08/2018, 14:28 - Eria Kamya: Who hasn't been allowed to express their views?
31/08/2018, 14:29 - +60 16-475 8556: especially if afande doesn't bring provocative issues...man filter them otherwise here is fire buuza nze...🤷🏿‍♂😅😅 am on mi president Bobi 2021 or now...but pple here think they us are cruising...smoothly.🤷🏿‍♂😅 be careful hahahah
31/08/2018, 14:29 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
31/08/2018, 14:30 - Eria Kamya: Leero kwendi obwedda abaneepikira baliwa? 🤣🤣🤣
31/08/2018, 14:31 - +60 16-475 8556: bawagala bigambo bajja wait😅😅
31/08/2018, 14:31 - +256 755 911999: Am sorry haven't you noticed the threats going around for journalists, even the common man who uses social media to express dissatisfaction is called and threatened... people have issues my friend if it wasn't so you'd not see anyone on the street. Also people come out to have peaceful demonstrations out of no where Police the army and all those security people start shooting...live bullets at that spraying tear gas, beating up civilians y????
31/08/2018, 14:32 - +60 17-631 2833: https://www.facebook.com/nbstelevision/videos/288428738654008/
31/08/2018, 14:34 - Eria Kamya: My dear friend, let's clearly separate issues and not treat them as though they're inseparable. Government is not threatening those who are expressing either their issues or dissatisfaction. Government is rather threatening those who incite violence, spread wrong information, mobilising riots etc of that sort. Simple.
31/08/2018, 14:34 - +256 755 911999: More so the government is strategically set up that people in power belonging to NRM are more...these people pass laws without even understanding the repercussions.. isn't that oppressing and muffling the voices of the minority parliamentarians who in a twisted way actually represent majority Ugandans??
31/08/2018, 14:36 - +60 16-475 8556: Which route...hmm..anti we are trying to be democratic otherwise..if yo temper is fragile then others who support nRM will not contribute anything you know...tebinyuma nga we are all for Bobi....😅😅😅 dats y smtimes you see me arguing with Eria though we are on the same side..just to have different views...my dia not to be one sided bibowa...
31/08/2018, 14:36 - +60 17-364 3269: Ani kwepikira
31/08/2018, 14:36 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂ owaaye oba ani
31/08/2018, 14:37 - +60 17-364 3269: Hmmm lol
31/08/2018, 14:38 - +256 755 911999: Who is inciting violence??? I have watched a number of clips from Bobi wines campaigns he has never told anyone to pick stones and throw them at anyone....rather he tells people to come out in droves and vote .... Also did you know that the constitution of Uganda actually allows for peaceful demonstrations??? People are to get permission from police..right?? Does this law actually work or its there for decoration?
31/08/2018, 14:38 - Eria Kamya: 😅😅 but I really missed that discussion
31/08/2018, 14:38 - +60 17-364 3269: Thank u
31/08/2018, 14:40 - +256 755 911999: It's the security forces inciting violence... You come and start beating people out of the blue like they are goats just coz they do not agree with your thought pattern... shooting live bullets at civilians...what do you expect them to do?? Stand there and get shot?? Ofcos they retaliate... As police army whatever your duty is to keep peace for all Ugandans not one guy and afew of his friends
31/08/2018, 14:42 - +60 16-475 8556: The law is never understood by any one coz if you ask police permission it will never accept especially at this moment so what politicians do they write a letter and if it replies or not they start demonstrations on the date stipulated in the letter.🤷🏿‍♂
31/08/2018, 14:42 - +256 755 911999: Ugandan youth have not been given a chance to express themselves.... These forces just always assume these are a bunch of undisciplined youth let's tear gas them to disperse them...let's shoot...is that the answer to this??? Really?
31/08/2018, 14:43 - +60 16-475 8556: This has bn so common even during Besigyes times.

31/08/2018, 14:43 - Eria Kamya: I didn't say bobi wine is inciting violence and actually don't know why everyone straight away thinks about bobi wine. I actually thought you meant the recent warning by Kayima that people who post or spread messages of intimidation, violence etc on social media. But for bobi, he may not incite violence but he may not control the angry youth. And funnily, he has never told people to stay calm yet if he does so people can listen and desist from violence. But he also keeps quiet and his fans do the violence. He should calm them. But even the words he uses.....
31/08/2018, 14:44 - +60 16-475 8556: Afaande bakibuuza aliwa ye?😅😅😅
31/08/2018, 14:44 - +60 17-631 2833: Will be right back
31/08/2018, 14:47 - +60 16-475 8556: man Bobis words are gd when entering a jungle for a war hahahaha😅😅 me I have watched him I like him especially at BugirI when he said mwe mutadewo emigongo gyamwe kwebaliira naye bwemusituka bwemuti ensaniya ziyiika😅😅😅 kanyumira nyo ako now to a ghetto boy oba omugamba kulumba indirectly..😅😅😅 but it was all politics...
31/08/2018, 14:47 - +256 755 911999: Dude check the guys clips... He always tells people to maintain order...he has actually been asked by police to go and calm people down... This is the same person accused of inciting violence... This government just wants to intimidate people and use fear to rule. Trust me it is a ticking time bomb.... At the end of the day some one will burst coz enough will have been enough. Trust me if these guys cared they'd sit down and listen to the youth.... But they are so out of touch it's crazy annoying

31/08/2018, 14:55 - Eria Kamya: He may not be able to escape by himself but others can do it because he's sick. And it may not be escaping but an attempt to fly him for better health care.
31/08/2018, 14:56 - Eria Kamya: Please answer me. Leero teri kwebuuzabuza

31/08/2018, 15:21 - Eria Kamya: So Marklyn I hope you've watched that video. Let's look at our leaders with an objective attitude because we're not obliged to please them but rather to shape them. I am not against bobi given my age. But the problem is that we're having many problems as Uganda and we're approaching them with a narrow approach.
31/08/2018, 15:22 - +60 17-631 2833: Kale mwe silaba makulu

31/08/2018, 15:28 - Eria Kamya: Could not access the content
31/08/2018, 15:28 - Eria Kamya: I don't know what's happening with Claire 🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂
31/08/2018, 15:34 - +60 17-631 2833: Cool the msg goes to those who k ow them selves who did so
31/08/2018, 15:34 - Eria Kamya: But probably you may not have clearly observed the video. If it was for a good cause there's no way he could have been misunderstood. And he would actually have shown that. But there's no way that he would have been misunderstood by those who were actually on the ground eg besigye, ingrid etc. You even saw how they reacted. 🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂
31/08/2018, 15:39 - +256 755 911999: I understand what you are saying...n I see him giving his competition alittle nudge ...i believe if he was the person said do be inciting violence...there would have been some fighting going on
31/08/2018, 15:40 - +60 11-5359 0769: Thx fornsharing this video... bt Bob and his supporters were jst passing... and If I may ask y is fdc using red colors too instead of blue?
31/08/2018, 15:43 - Eria Kamya: Of course that didn't happen in such a fragile campaign situation anything can happen just as it did later that evening when they met the presidential group. But let's not go further because like I said, I am not saying that bobi is violent but I can't rule that out.
31/08/2018, 15:43 - +60 11-5359 0769: Am sorry bt to it looks like Besigye is not minding mch abt it... but bcz Eria wants to prove that Bobi is bad he is so concerned about it
31/08/2018, 15:43 - +60 17-631 2833: 👏👏👏🧐
31/08/2018, 15:45 - +60 11-5359 0769: If these pipo were really against each we wud have seen the worst btn the two groups jst like it hpnd later wen they met the nrm group

01/09/2018, 07:10 - Eria Kamya: Some people don't understand how to deal with the public, or what people want.
01/09/2018, 08:20 - +60 16-475 8556: Ekizibu naye mwajja akasimbi...we are now charged...forgot about even his efforts of 60M for illy needy kids...just bse aliku side nfuuu nyo...bambi pity for him...that's people power..omuliro ogutwakiramu gusiinga gwetuyitamu...💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
01/09/2018, 08:26 - Eria Kamya: Being on the wrong side is not a problem, but knowing what people want is the way. Right now everyone in the city is on bobi wine. But this guy cannot even say anything good or encouraging about his fellow artist. Just being sentimental would be okay.
01/09/2018, 08:32 - +60 16-475 8556: and for him doesn't pretend ko at all he's too musevenist..even when his dad boycotted NRM system and made his own party ppp you remember? Bebe still remained with M7..simanyi kabala...oba future opposition?.he's not like Chameleon him is a money maker alina ssente yamutwaala...but Bebe bambi...ahaa mungu amubererewo...
01/09/2018, 08:39 - Eria Kamya: Of course we know he's stuck to his side which is also good. But knowing the people you deal with is very important. A single statement or act would satisfy them. It's not bad to say something that is not being done well but it doesn't mean you've left your side. For instance, if you're a Christian and moslems invite you to grace their function, you can't start preaching your Gospel from there. It's just not proper. If bebe stood up against the torture of bobi, it would show that he's concerned as a Ugandan. It doesn't mean you've started boycotting your party. It's common sense and about human rights. But he simply used the chance to say negative things about him.
01/09/2018, 08:46 - +60 16-475 8556: Then there maybe be he has no good handlers atte akyalinamu namalala nga bwebaali ne Bobi...
01/09/2018, 08:50 - +60 16-475 8556: now music tanyuma bulungi nga his beef mate ali mu politics...yebowa so he wants to use the same platform as Bobi did to pressure him...and the challenge he has is he's an S6...raggamaphin yt Bobi is a diploma ganjjaplanter kati he has a big load...only fame and dad being a grt local govt minister with clean name...gives him some pivot to stand...
01/09/2018, 08:50 - Eria Kamya: He's taking the competition too far and he's facing the consequences.
01/09/2018, 08:51 - +60 16-475 8556: Otherwise akyaali bubi nyo and again Bobi is at sch..pursuing law you know...I think hes now in 2nd yr...
01/09/2018, 08:52 - Eria Kamya: Now this why education is important. Because a degree holder can't be at the same level of thinking with an s6 dropout. That's why bebe cool failed to understand something here.
01/09/2018, 08:52 - +60 16-475 8556: ya he needs gd handlers with gd publicrelationship skills ...🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂
01/09/2018, 08:53 - Eria Kamya: Yaah
01/09/2018, 08:54 - +60 16-475 8556: ya just as I said he has a big challenge...he plays public musically but politically.. still a struggle for him to undertake.
01/09/2018, 08:59 - Eria Kamya: Yaah
01/09/2018, 09:06 - +60 16-475 8556: I think its y J chameleon doesn't fight Bobi so much coz hez also a s6 gangster though hes been on top of them musically for yrs I think wisdom and yo background also matter alot...remember in sm interview Jossy said Bobi is an upcoming revolutionalist meaning he respected that path...but Bebe said Bobi failed musically and decided to join politics.. 🤷🏿‍♂😅
01/09/2018, 09:10 - Eria Kamya: 😅😅😅 true bro, but your background in most cases doesn't teach you public relations. It only teaches you how to respect others your own morals. But public relations is attained academically. You know the education process teaches us a lot throughout the whole journey. 🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂
01/09/2018, 09:12 - Eria Kamya: Ye banange Where's Claire and her colleagues?? 🤷🏻‍♂ last time she was calling out loudly for Kalungi and I. I am sure they have their own views about this.
01/09/2018, 09:16 - +60 16-475 8556: kituufu naye omuuntu ayimbidde ebanga eddene elyo lyona oba wayigga how to charge and embrace pple psychologically or mentally...just as they have been doing musically.🤷🏿‍♂
01/09/2018, 09:19 - Eria Kamya: True but education is not like apprenticeship. It's not an art to be mastered with time. It's something else bro 🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂
01/09/2018, 09:19 - +60 16-475 8556: how śure are you nti they like this...bagala bibazimba ebisinga kubino😅

01/09/2018, 09:22 - Eria Kamya: Education is just uniquely and intrinsically important. Just know 😅😅😅
01/09/2018, 09:23 - +60 11-2895 6258: I personally don't support violence. In my opinion I think they shouldn't have misbehaved in such manner just because they like the fact that babycool supports m7. I thought it's democracy and everyone has the right to support whoever they like
01/09/2018, 09:24 - +60 16-475 8556: important waapi okujjako okutuba...eggwanga lyonna mulimazeewo olwokuba mwasoma nyo😅😅
01/09/2018, 09:24 - +60 11-2895 6258: We can't all support bobi wine even when Jesus called his sheep's even the Satan's ones came along
01/09/2018, 09:25 - Eria Kamya: Oba nfune ka mukalakaasa 😅😅😅
01/09/2018, 09:26 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
01/09/2018, 09:27 - +60 11-2895 6258: On the other hand I put it to him that if he knows that he doesn't support bobi in such situation he should keep his mouth shut and that why his mouth has caused him all this like in his song "kaba kamwako"
01/09/2018, 09:27 - +60 16-475 8556: Yo right munange naye nga embeera yakyuuse nali neutral alugenderamu...gwe  tewalaba amagye bwegakalakata owa Algerzeerah...hmm😅😅 as if yali oba amenya Bank of Uganda....
01/09/2018, 09:28 - +60 16-475 8556: ne kengere
01/09/2018, 09:28 - Eria Kamya: True but like the example I gave about moslems, it also applies here. Remember people don't forget. Prior to this event the same guy was chased from the stage. Now that was when he would have used public relations though it would still be late.
01/09/2018, 09:28 - Eria Kamya: Hahaha kyekyo wamma
01/09/2018, 09:28 - +60 11-2895 6258: If he claims not to be a politician then I think he should go do the singing and go back home than opening his dirty mouth . keeping quiet is the most important medicine I have ever seen
01/09/2018, 09:29 - +60 16-475 8556: kasita precious waali baleke abakikiridde naye simanyi oba byayogera byebagala.😅😅😅😅 okuwulira

01/09/2018, 09:34 - +60 11-2895 6258: We all know his side: you can't just talk nonsense in front of people I thought he had gone there to do singing not politics so why did he do that is he a politician
01/09/2018, 09:34 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
01/09/2018, 09:34 - +60 11-2895 6258: You can't mix music with politics and that's where he messed up

01/09/2018, 12:22 - +60 16-639 0643: Whoever is occupying your seat of breakthrough, closing your door of favour, scattering your seed of progress, pointing accusing finger at you, fabricating lies against you, plotting your downfall, shooting negative arrows and bullet at you, today the power of God will reverse all their evil plans and send their wishes back to them by the grace of God.
I pray that Almighty God will satisfy you with all the desire of your heart. You will be a reference point of success to others and God will keep a permanent smile on your face in Jesus Mighty Name Amen. Happy New month.
01/09/2018, 12:25 - +60 11-3637 6788: Amen
01/09/2018, 15:25 - +256 701 406572: Thank you. I support you on this. Many people are now being mobilised to resist violent politics emerging in our generation. If opposition abandons violence methods and intelligently calm their supporters, the future will be bright fot out kids.
01/09/2018, 15:28 - +60 17-364 3269: How can the opposition abandon violent measures wen the govt uses violence at every chance it gets . Who is shooting people is it opposition or the govt in power . Who refuses people to demonstrate peacefully even after they have gotten police permission . Bobi always tells his supporters to b peaceful . The govt should b the teach the youths to peaceful . If the govt is not peaceful neither will the opposition . U reap wat u sow
01/09/2018, 15:28 - Eria Kamya: But honestly no one has ever incited violence more than the police.
01/09/2018, 15:28 - +60 17-364 3269: Thank you
01/09/2018, 15:33 - Eria Kamya: This is how I support my statement. If police has never come up conclusion about their investigations, have never granted approval to those who seek peaceful gatherings from them, the way they handle people including journalists, the way they get their suspects etc, then they're the ones inciting violence. Because this creates continued anger from people.
01/09/2018, 15:43 - +60 16-475 8556: 👏🏿👏🏿👍🏿👍🏿
01/09/2018, 15:45 - +60 16-475 8556: Afaande awedde nkuwe ani Ssebo?😅😅

01/09/2018, 15:48 - +256 701 406572: Have you ever seen riots or protests in Bugolobi, Nakawa, Kololo, Muyega, etc? Why always Kisekka, Mpererwe,  Kamokya? Security mapping will come up with solutions. In Russia, any protest from any building in city, the owners pay heavily. In Kla, protestors can throw stones from Plaza and walk free. In Kisekka, it's like rioters have rented three buildings near market. Anyway, we may never have patient and tolerent Commander -in-Chief for many years to come.
01/09/2018, 15:49 - +60 16-475 8556: 😅😅😅😅 oyo onomusobola  ye nga tayagala bya kumujja kumulamwa..ate gwe ojja abaantu kumilamwa...

01/09/2018, 15:55 - Eria Kamya: Afande olimbyeemu ssebo. You're about to ask me whether I have ever seen a protest in a church, mosque or temple. You wanted people to protest from their homes? Besides that any protest can erupt anywhere. In fact I don't know why you only chose few places.
01/09/2018, 15:55 - +60 16-475 8556: in bugolobi we have also many pple from non govt organisations bbo balumwaaki?
01/09/2018, 15:58 - Eria Kamya: As if afande didn't know all this. Kyokka banange Afande. The next time you'll ask why why football protests occur in a playground
01/09/2018, 15:58 - +60 16-475 8556: and those ppl protest on social media just like in this group...and for those who love their nation.aat heart
01/09/2018, 15:59 - +60 16-475 8556: 😅😅😅 not on roadsides or streets.
01/09/2018, 16:00 - Eria Kamya: Exactly!!!
01/09/2018, 16:02 - +60 16-475 8556: afaande oba alinayo akalala akaleete tukalye...😅😅😅 oba talina ngonsaba omulala😅😅
01/09/2018, 16:05 - Eria Kamya: Kati kyesitegeera oba afande thinks *omuntu wawansi* also includes people in such places as bugoloobi 🤣😅🤷🏻‍♂ if they're there maybe 2%. Those people might not be regular visitors to the aforementioned places to buy things. Instead they regularly visit supermarkets. 

These riots are steered by those described as abantu bawansi or those who fight for abantu bawansi.
01/09/2018, 16:05 - Eria Kamya: Oli tonamumpa
01/09/2018, 16:08 - +60 16-475 8556: and most of 2/ work for those ppl in there like security guys..domestic workers...constructors ...and others
01/09/2018, 16:09 - +60 16-475 8556: oba nkuwe Bambino kuba oli kirabika akyetegeka
01/09/2018, 16:09 - +256 755 911999: This is where Sevo is still getting support.... The elite ...these people are in with the person who protects their businesses and their property. That's why you never hear of such things in some areas....but the affected people join demonstrations in town. These are the guys the opposition need on their side.... The business men ...  As long as their businesses are safe they continue to support....in Bugolobi people usually boycott shops/supermarkets linked to big big guys in government
01/09/2018, 16:10 - Eria Kamya: Exactly!!! You'd also have deserved a special gift naye lwakuba oli musajja. We have to empower ladies 😅😅😅🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂
01/09/2018, 16:12 - Eria Kamya: Actually most of them don't even want to know about politics. Because most of them are rich, others are highly educated and their future is guaranteed.
01/09/2018, 16:18 - +256 755 911999: There's that.... But not everyone living in these neighbourhoods is as rich as you'd imagine.... There are some loaded guys true but their also middle class income earners.... I for one live in Bugos but trust me...I am affected by those things... Private medical services my friend!!!😳🙆🏾‍♀you fall sick you just start looking for herbs because consultation only is 40,000k remember am unemployed....nanti it's for who you know...my dad is not about that life.... he's like I paid fees now let the education get you in.... Mom can try to naye munange it's not asif she knows everyone.... People just promise you air.... we have some funny roads and the crime rate is real...so....
01/09/2018, 16:19 - +60 16-475 8556: gender inequality😅😅😅
01/09/2018, 16:22 - Eria Kamya: Of course not everyone but at least the mixture already explains why there can't be a protest. Because some are *loaded* while others are *loaders* 😅😅🤷🏻‍♂🤷🏻‍♂. Now these two can't mix up for a protest. But in those kisekka, kamwokya places, almost everyone is at the same status. But still there are also loaded guys in kamwokya.
01/09/2018, 16:23 - +60 16-475 8556: so touching but I think its everywhere dats y pple in those areas do loot when a riot sparks off...and smtymz they are given tax holiday...now check nakawa does shoprite ku game pay tax ate nga baseera okamala hmm🤷🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂

01/09/2018, 16:51 - Eria Kamya: Even me am getting confused. He goes then comes back then goes... Nze am even starting to lose trust in the way he says his condition is.
01/09/2018, 16:51 - +60 18-364 0070: Does high education really guarantee someone's future? 🤔🤔🤔
01/09/2018, 16:52 - Eria Kamya: Very certainly
01/09/2018, 16:55 - +60 18-364 0070: How so Mr. Eria?
01/09/2018, 16:58 - Eria Kamya: With a high education, if you can't fail to get a job in any regime. It's a matter of time. A PhD holder can at least be a lecturer in the worst case.
01/09/2018, 17:01 - +60 18-364 0070: Hmmm
01/09/2018, 17:01 - Eria Kamya: Do you agree with me?

01/09/2018, 17:12 - Eria Kamya: For sure you guys will forgive me, but I am starting to doubt bobi
01/09/2018, 17:12 - +256 755 911999: I don't think so.being highly educated doesn't mean anything if you have no actual skills and smarts to back it uo

01/09/2018, 17:14 - Eria Kamya: If you have no skills then you didn't pass or graduate. I didn't mean those who failed. I meant those who passed or graduated at such levels.

01/09/2018, 17:19 - +60 18-364 0070: Most highly educated people lack financial freedom....they are paid peanuts for the kind of work they do..so in some sense their future is not guaranteed either
01/09/2018, 17:20 - Eria Kamya: Highly education starts from having a PhD in my understanding. And I gave a simple example about this. I mean the simplest example to show that atleast they're secured for employment.

01/09/2018, 22:00 - +60 17-364 3269: Oooooh afande this is black mail . As much as God wants us to obey the govt. , He wants us to b free as well. In Genesis God have man freedom . And the Govt has no right to oppress Gods people . That’s y he sent Moses to free the Israelites from Egypt , from the govt He created . God used David to defeat the govt he created bse it oppressed people . Kings r to b just leaders r to b fair . N if they r not . They shall b defeated .
01/09/2018, 22:03 - Eria Kamya: But in the Bible as it appears in the photo above, it was clear that the government doesn't threaten those doing right.
01/09/2018, 22:04 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes that part talks about true democracy . Where people have fair n just leaders n law and they have to follow it .
01/09/2018, 22:04 - +60 17-364 3269: We don’t have that afande in uganda
01/09/2018, 22:04 - +256 755 911999: Lol as we can see the govt is threatened otherwise I doubt it would go to such extreme measures if everything was okay
01/09/2018, 22:04 - +60 17-364 3269: So stop using the bible to support a failed govt
01/09/2018, 22:04 - +60 17-364 3269: It’s  a very desperate measure
01/09/2018, 22:04 - Eria Kamya: 😅😅🤔
01/09/2018, 22:05 - Eria Kamya: But Uganda is in a very big dilemma but many people are not seeing it.
01/09/2018, 22:06 - +60 17-364 3269: Well more eyes have become open
01/09/2018, 22:07 - Eria Kamya: And what hurts me is that we had a clear chance and these mps let us down 🙁
01/09/2018, 22:07 - +60 17-364 3269: Exactly
01/09/2018, 22:08 - Eria Kamya: Maybe you didn't get it the way I wanted
01/09/2018, 22:08 - +60 17-364 3269: How did u want it
01/09/2018, 22:08 - +256 755 911999: ????
01/09/2018, 22:09 - Eria Kamya: They didn't think about the consequences yet they were clear
01/09/2018, 22:09 - +60 17-364 3269: I already got that
01/09/2018, 22:09 - Eria Kamya: I mean the age limit lifting. This was the time to change things peacefully.
01/09/2018, 22:11 - Eria Kamya: The dilemma is actually yet to intensify. Because I think we're going to have more deaths.
01/09/2018, 22:13 - Eria Kamya: And I think government will do all it takes to prevent bobi from standing for presidency in 2021
01/09/2018, 22:15 - +60 17-364 3269: They don’t have the right to stop him. If mabirizi could contest wat reason will they have to stop bobi .  , I think they rig votes .
01/09/2018, 22:18 - Eria Kamya: You see they've tasted his power and influence, so risking him would be a total gamble. So I think they will hide in the law and fake charges.
01/09/2018, 22:18 - +60 17-364 3269: I guess so
01/09/2018, 22:21 - Eria Kamya: And I think they'll give him all the liberty of travelling abroad for treatment, but just postponing and taking their time until that time when he can't stand due to the fact that he will be under investigations and still in court.
01/09/2018, 22:21 - +256 755 911999: If I were Bobi I would not stand in 2021... I however would really behind a guy like Muntu... Guy's manifesto is solid and his not too old like the sevoz or young like Bobi...he would be what I'd call an intermediate leader....so that the old people don't feel disconnected and disgruntled and the young people don't feel left out. Meanwhile in parliament I would table term limits. 8 years maximum.... And bring back age limits.... Then I'd go on the ground and do work....rally people on... Organise my voters then come thru...
01/09/2018, 22:23 - Eria Kamya: That is what government wants. The moment bobi is out of the race, government will even go to kyankwanzi and roast bulls 😅😅😅😅
01/09/2018, 22:23 - +256 701 406572: But age limit does not remove power of masses to vote anyone they want in 2021
01/09/2018, 22:28 - +256 755 911999: Standing in 2021 for Bobi seems like the obvious thing to do.... But as an up coming political analyst and politician, 2021 wouldnt be idle. However, most people are voting whoever Bobi wine is endorsing... so he should rally for a solid guy like Muntu........Muntu will get in and clean up because he has been involved for a while so he knows where the mess is...as we know an old broom knows all the corners.....this way when Bobi stands next election, he is picking up from something solid...otw the mess right now might overwhelm him
01/09/2018, 22:28 - Eria Kamya: Naye afande you want us to now discuss that?? First of all it would kick mzee out the next presidential race. The country would now be focused on the transition. Second of to be honest afande, we have no trust in the electoral commission come 2021. The president publicly threatened to sack them and you're here telling us that people can still vote who they want. They'll vote who they want, but the commission under threats will be forced to manipulate results
01/09/2018, 22:31 - Eria Kamya: It's a good idea if bobi points to someone, but that's what government wants. Remember I don't think people can stand up for whoever bobi endorses in the same way they're willing to stand up for bobi. So the story will just continue. Remember next elections will be bloody and by all means I think nrm will win.
01/09/2018, 22:33 - +256 701 406572: No need to stop him my brother. Gandhi of India was popular but Nuhur became a leader. Its sometimes not easy to turn popularity into majority votes and take over power. Voting is not done on whatsup or in Kamokya or Kisekka alone. But deep in jungles of Rwenzori, plains of Kotido and Ibanda. Let us watch the space in 2021. True Central Uganda media has tried to brand Bobi Wine and like British Press did with likes of Walcott, Wilshere, time became best judge.
01/09/2018, 22:34 - +60 11-2895 6258: Thanks
01/09/2018, 22:36 - +60 17-364 3269: How old was m7 wen he got into power . Wat z age got to do with it . M7 is old enough to see that wat his doing is wrong but he has failed . I understand that that older people r supposed to have wisdom . Well ave meant a lot of stupid old people . N also there young people with wisdom. Sometimes it’s just destiny . If u were meant to b a leader age has nothing to do with it
01/09/2018, 22:36 - Eria Kamya: How will bobi wine reach the deep areas of rwenzori when they've started forging crimes against him? Everything he will try to do or go somewhere to campaign they'll say he's inciting violence and will stop him either.
01/09/2018, 22:36 - +256 755 911999: I think this depends on how he campaigns plus it's not like he would not be in parliament...we have a party that has been in power for 32 years now they have used the peace story, poverty and illiteracy as a means to an end... Many people who vote for Sevo vote for him out of a fear instilled in them that if Sevo is not president, Uganda will never have peace, the education does nothing to enlighten the masses and poverty makes people so cheap they sell their votes for as low as 2000.
01/09/2018, 22:38 - +60 17-364 3269: Bobi Wine is not new to scene , he is already famous for his music .. he will get there . He managed to get votes I. Arua n other places . He will get there.
01/09/2018, 22:40 - Eria Kamya: You see we're dealing with old people who are both smart and powerful.
01/09/2018, 22:40 - +60 17-364 3269: Not if the people power becomes a Democratic Party n they get a good team n plan well . They can beat nrm . This is the problem with Ugandans u think nrm cannot b defeated . Nrm will not rule for ever . They will get off n there party will become history just like dp
01/09/2018, 22:41 - +256 755 911999: <Media omitted>
01/09/2018, 22:42 - +60 17-364 3269: And those people r stupid , do they think sevo will live forever . After sevo who will vote for nrm . No one
01/09/2018, 22:43 - +60 17-364 3269: Old people u mean sevo . Then y did they loose in Arua n other places . If they can loose to these simple guys . They can loose a full election
01/09/2018, 22:43 - Eria Kamya: Hahaha of course nrm is not the ultimate party. But right now it's very tricky to deal with this party. It has established a lot of influence in the government institutions due to corruptions
01/09/2018, 22:44 - +256 755 911999: but this is not the Bobi mentality.... political parties act as barriers between people...they create an instant dislike this causes the things we are seeing of FDC supporters beat nrm guys.....we need to be united.... That way we are stronger... A team that is divided rarely makes the points
01/09/2018, 22:44 - +60 17-364 3269: Yes it has , but it can be defeated . Wat ur Instilling that it can’t b defeated , n am telling u ur wrong . It can b defeated
01/09/2018, 22:45 - Eria Kamya: It can be defeated of course but very hard at this time
01/09/2018, 22:46 - +256 755 911999: <Media omitted>
01/09/2018, 22:47 - +60 17-364 3269: People power has to become a party . That is the only way to kick out nrm in Parliament . People power is new n fresh n it’s does not have any history if the bush . It instead represents the future . Opposition can work together if they want . But bobi has a greater chance of having control if he gets other people besides him in his party . Working alone to fight nrm is just not wise even with besigye it’s not wise
01/09/2018, 22:47 - +60 17-364 3269: People power will unite more people than Fdc n nrm
01/09/2018, 22:48 - +60 17-364 3269: Infact people will cross over from fdc n nrm to people power
01/09/2018, 22:51 - +60 17-364 3269: I don’t disagree with u . But fdc cannot b the only choice we have . People power is our other choice . They can form a coalition n win the election but after that . People power as a Democratic Party has to b in existence for some of us who can’t belong to fdc nrm n dp lol . People power is our party . The coalition can b formed in the election time
01/09/2018, 22:53 - +60 17-364 3269: Bambino do u know that many us don’t belong to any Democratic Party , in uganda . Bse we cannot relate with any of those parties . We were born after the bush . People power is something we can relate with . It should become a party to cater fro us.
01/09/2018, 22:53 - +60 17-364 3269: For us
01/09/2018, 22:54 - +60 17-364 3269: Pp is a sign of a future
01/09/2018, 22:54 - Eria Kamya: <Media omitted>
01/09/2018, 22:55 - +256 755 911999: You are only proving my point... The division...the same way you feel like you can't belong to FDC is the same way another person feels they can't belong to people power... We are first and foremost all Ugandans....in the struggle... It would do us alot of good to do away with these things of tribalism, religious segregations, political parties all that stuff is just there to cause divisions...
01/09/2018, 23:02 - +60 17-364 3269: U don’t get wat I mean . Opposition has to form a coalition to beat nrm that’s true . But wen that election is done . Looking into the future of Uganda . Some of us need a political party that does not have the word bush onto it . Something that signifies the future n not the past . Pp does that . N besides the only way the coalition can b successful is if the opposition is fully organised . Now if they have parties . They can easily organise each other than if they just work alone . Those men that bobi got for votes could wake up in the morning wen they have joined nrm party . Or fdc party . Parties r there for organisation . For uganda to have good democracy we need to have democracy within the parties , pp should b the other party that shows that . That teaches the youth to b good leaders . This more than just the election , this is about the future . Bringing more youth to the table . N bringing more patriots to the table . A coalition has to b made definitely . But if am asked wat party I belong to right now . It is people power . That’s all . Until the election wen fdc n others join us . It is people power.  N btw people power does not support tribalism
01/09/2018, 23:04 - +256 755 911999: Being kept under house arrest doesn't mean work can't continue.... Does he carry the entire situation on his shoulders??? He has to work with other people in these different places. Notice there is an nrm office in early every district in Uganda.... Do we see Sevo there??? But "work" gets done... There's a presence...
01/09/2018, 23:05 - +60 17-364 3269: Bambi u have made by point . Exactly y pp should become a party , so bobi could get help
01/09/2018, 23:05 - +60 17-364 3269: He does not have to do everything alone

01/09/2018, 23:12 - Eria Kamya: Me I suspect that government will always be blocking bobi. We've seen that when they block like four people from going somewhere. Last time they blocked besigye, lukwago, ingrid, basalirwa from going to gulu
01/09/2018, 23:13 - +256 755 911999: That's y he should infiltrate the community with its own people...to help bring about the desired change....the blocking will always happen but the evidence shall be there
01/09/2018, 23:21 - Eria Kamya: <Media omitted>
01/09/2018, 23:21 - Eria Kamya: Then that's a long project
01/09/2018, 23:22 - Eria Kamya: Not just making people power a party but it should replace all other opposition parties.

02/09/2018, 08:18 - Eria Kamya: So what do you think is the reality because it might mean different things to different people.
02/09/2018, 08:55 - +256 701 406572: A wise man once said that the future only belongs to those who have the ability to foresee it and sacrifice the pleasures of the present in order to gain it. 
As I read through a financial report that Apple (Company) has entered the trillion dollars realm, I was curious to know more about the company. In my search, I stumbled into a pathetic story concerning one of the co-founders of Apple by name, Ronald Wayne. This man co-founded Apple Computers (now Apple Inc.) with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. He drew the first Apple logo, drafted the first original agreement between the founders and wrote the first manual for their first computer. He held a 10% share in the company but soon decided to relinquish it for $800 and was given additional $1500 to forfeit all right of ownership two weeks after the company was officially registered in 1976. His reason for that decision was that the company was financially demanding. Today, if Ronald Wayne had kept his 10% share, he would have been worth over a 100 billion dollars. That would have made him the richest or second richest man on earth. But the total value of what Ronald Wayne collected in 1976 stands at $ 9,498 in 2017. Today Ronald Wayne is worth $ 300,000 less than the million dollar mark, yet the agreement he drafted was sold for over a million dollars after he left. The first Apple product he ever owned was iPad 2 given to him in 2011. 
Ronald Wayne said it was demanding on him financially. If only he saw today, his decision of 1976 would have been so different. 
Everything of lasting value is highly demanding. Greatness is not a product of convenience. The greatness of tomorrow begins with the sacrifice of today. 
If you need to live in a one room apartment today to own an estate tomorrow do!
If you need to ride a tricycle today in order to distribute a Rolls Royce tomorrow Pls do!
If you need to patronize fairly used clothes today to own a boutique tomorrow Pls do!  
*The pain of knowing you had the opportunity at a point in life to change the course of your life is the greatest pain of regret to live with.* 
Today Ronald Wayne in his right will be said to be financially OK at $300,000 but hearing the news that the company he cofounded is the first company to hit the trillion dollars mark will send many thoughts to his mind. And the children? Had our father....... Only God can describe what will be going on in their minds.
*My counsel:*
*Where you see a future don't fail to invest*
*Where you see a future don't fail to sacrifice*
*Where you see a future don't fail to endure.*
*Where you see a future don't fail to persist*
*Where you see a future don't fail to believe.*

The future truly belongs to those who can foresee it and give all it takes to get there. If you don't remember anything I have said so far, don't ever forget that, *" Greatness in life is not a product of convenience.”* It takes sacrifice.

02/09/2018, 13:03 - Eria Kamya: It would be interesting.... But that's highly subjective. The whole education from kindergarten to postdoc is a choice. No one should make you think that a PhD is the only way to go. I'm not authoritative here, but that was my view. Of course as per your submission, I can agree with you to a certain, small extent.
02/09/2018, 13:04 - Eria Kamya: You do that to your parents?? 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
02/09/2018, 13:14 - +60 16-475 8556: Especially harsh dads and rude mums...🤣🤣🤣

02/09/2018, 14:40 - Eria Kamya: Me I only have one question. If someone can beat you to the extent of breaking "both legs" then why not at least a single arm?  How can one break both your legs and doesn't do anything to your arms?
02/09/2018, 14:41 - Eria Kamya: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂

02/09/2018, 14:49 - Eria Kamya: Who told you he was the one escaping himself?  Of course either his caretakers or anyone else. Did you even watch the news when his caretakers claimed that police wanted to grab him from hospital at night?
02/09/2018, 14:53 - +60 16-475 8556: 🤣🤣🤣mbu escaping himself...😅😅 naye Kamya...enway oyo OC baali balina kusiba busibi...imagine if they grabbed or snatched him out there..and he happened to die...okimanyi singa Uganda eyaka nokusingawo.?

02/09/2018, 15:06 - +60 11-5359 0769: So u wanted to c his arms broken too... did anyone say that his legs were broken? Where did u read it? I might b behind news... all I have heard is kidney and back pain... and if sm1 can not move on his own bcz of pain, he therefore shudnt move at all?
02/09/2018, 15:08 - +60 11-5359 0769: May b am behind news...if am wrong u can correct me... bt personally I havent read anywhere that his legs were broken for sure
02/09/2018, 15:11 - Eria Kamya: Y would I want to see his arms broken?? Of course I wouldn't. But maybe if it's back pain then it could be a different story. But I have watched his sitting posture right from the court up to now in the plane.
02/09/2018, 15:13 - +60 11-5359 0769: So he conived with the prison officers and whoever visited him including the deputy speaker... bcz they all said he was in bad condition okugyako gwe ne Afande...
02/09/2018, 15:15 - Eria Kamya: So what is the use of the clutches and wheel chair if he's legs are okay?  Are they for the back pain? 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂ anyway
02/09/2018, 15:15 - +60 16-475 8556: omulina🤣🤣🤣
02/09/2018, 15:17 - Eria Kamya: In fact you have forgotten to mention those who said his kidney was damaged when they visited him in the prison. As if they were doctors. I think I have answered you. If not, tell me to be more clear.
02/09/2018, 15:17 - +60 11-5359 0769: Dont u knw that sm1 can fail to walk on his own bcz of back pain... leka nawe mbadde manyi ebintu ebimu obimanyi nti bisoboka...

02/09/2018, 15:19 - +60 16-475 8556: what affects the back seemingly may affect the kidneys coz they are embedded on the inside of the back..🤷🏿‍♂
02/09/2018, 15:19 - +60 16-475 8556: Nyweeza 🤣🤣🤣🤣
02/09/2018, 15:20 - Eria Kamya: If someone can't walk because of back pain, then even proper sitting would be a problem to them. But with his posture bro ahaaa. Because I think that's when they'd feel more pain because when you sit down, a lot of effort is needed from the back
02/09/2018, 15:20 - +60 16-475 8556: Totagala terera offune knock out yo...🤣🤣🤣🤣
02/09/2018, 15:21 - Eria Kamya: Ate abakadde eyo different story naawe. Everything on them is almost broken

02/09/2018, 15:24 - Eria Kamya: Not sleeping, but a person who is in pain can be seen. For the wheel chair it's okay to sit that way. But elsewhere I don't think so. He sits freely, cross-legged, upright 😅😅🤷‍♂🤣🤣🤣
02/09/2018, 15:25 - +60 11-5359 0769: U mean pain is feature that can be seen with eyes?
02/09/2018, 15:25 - Eria Kamya: With posture it can be seen

02/09/2018, 15:33 - +256 701 406572: I have no personal grudge with Bobi but God is the best judge. Ethically, he has won sympathy of many Ugandans but morally, his advisors are evil. At one time, doctors who examined him will also talk. Americans will test him clinically and know the hypocrisy in third world. Iam lucky to have seen him when he was even doing body exercises. Its his wife who advised him to fake everything but lies can not last. Doctors are just laughing silently coz apart from head bruises, all his bornes, organs like kidney are safe. Let us wait for American doctors too.
02/09/2018, 15:33 - +60 16-475 8556: Hassan emiruundi...🙆🏿‍♂🤣🤣🤣🤣

02/09/2018, 15:36 - Eria Kamya: Exactly!!! 💪💪💪

02/09/2018, 16:01 - Eria Kamya: So if the doctors are already operating him, then what is being treated that is hard to tell the whole world?? Are they looking for internal damages inside him and that the scans couldn't see them?
02/09/2018, 16:03 - +60 16-475 8556: not everything can be seen by scan no...
02/09/2018, 16:03 - Eria Kamya: I am not ruling out that bobi wasn't tortured or damaged. But I always look at the other possible scenario in every situation. Why are they taking long to give us feedback?

03/09/2018, 07:44 - Eria Kamya: Actually you've reminded of what lord mayor lukwago and Allan sewanyana said. I hope they're also among the fools you're talking about  😅😅
03/09/2018, 07:45 - Eria Kamya: Because they also wanted to create public sympathy for bobi.
03/09/2018, 07:51 - +60 11-5359 0769: Leero gwe naawe Eria olabika oliko ekikyamu enaku zino... hw can u say that sm1 who has been beaten is faking pain?!🤔 And u also support such foolish statement... they were a number of mps who were arrested in Arua... y those two? Let's use our senses... we shud not be taken by politics from the truth...
03/09/2018, 07:54 - +60 11-5359 0769: @IHK alabika mutuufu nrm yabaloga temukyalowooza... omusajja wa prisons yagamba baabawa bakube ate kati omuntu atabakyaliira nga nako agamba nti they r faking pain and u r also blindly following
03/09/2018, 07:57 - +60 11-5359 0769: If the officers confirmed that they received these already *badly beated*, wat else shud we say sm1 who says they r faking pain to mk him use his senses?
03/09/2018, 07:58 - Eria Kamya: Don't skip the point bro. I know you're trying to be smart. Right now the point isn't about faking pain, because of course he must be experiencing some pain. But the point is about the intensity of his condition and how certain people have chosen to escalate the whole situation. Why are you accusing the government officials, yet you don't want to accuse those two guys I have mentioned? Did you even hear what they announced to the public about the state of bobi's health?  Do you even know what it would have resulted in? In fact it resulted in deaths of innocent Ugandans. But when bobi wine came out he was better than they had announced. But already the lives of innocent Ugandans had been lost. Why do you only look at one side of issues?
03/09/2018, 08:06 - +60 11-5359 0769: In fact nrm supporters u dont have the moral authority to talk abt the innocent lives that r lost... in the first place who kills them? And who killed first? How can sm1 sitted in car throw a stone to a presidential motorcade? And remember these pipo were far from wher the alleged stone throwing is said to have occured... muganda wange zukuuka... u r trying to defend the undefendables... abt ur issue of sewanyana and lord mayor... they r not drs.. they jst spoke wat they came to their mind at first sight of Zaake bcz remember no1 new where these guys had taken bobi for almost a week...
03/09/2018, 08:08 - +60 11-5359 0769: Until sm1 tells that these pipo were not beaten I will agree that they faking pain.. naye ono kasasiro nze siyinza kumukiriza
03/09/2018, 08:09 - +60 11-5359 0769: Ekitwala kusomero kkula ebirowoozo na iq... sikusoma science na kubala bwoka.. muganda okusoma kuyigiriza okulowooza...
03/09/2018, 08:09 - Eria Kamya: We all know that bobi wine must have been beaten. But I think it was normal beating and not dangerous beating. But what doesn't help us is to escalate issues. Remember bobi wine has many die hard fans. These are so emotional and any sensitive information takes them to the streets, which is okay. But this comes with loss of innocent lives. And the most unfortunate thing is when the sensitive information was actually not true or less true.
03/09/2018, 08:10 - +60 11-5359 0769: U think it was normal beating.. nti bamugamba galamira tukube kibooko 3 w'okwatayo tetugyibala...😂😂

03/09/2018, 08:28 - +60 11-2803 7720: A *VERY IMPORTANT* notice coming up
03/09/2018, 08:31 - Eria Kamya: 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
03/09/2018, 08:42 - +60 11-2803 7720: *IMPORTANT NOTICE*

Fellow members, 
I wish to bring to your attention the frustration of other members as concerns the current conduct in this group. 

Ideally, this group was formed to coordinate and to fuel discussions and engagement amongst Uganda students and alumni. Our core values and principles prohibit the use of defamatory, abusive, profane, threatening, offensive language.

As you may be aware, recently, there has been derogation in the core values and principles of this group caused by the continued use of derogatory comments and offensive language which exhibits uncouth behaviour.

As such, and for the betterment of all members of the group, the EXCO members of Association that started this WhatsApp group have unanimously agreed to ban *DISCUSSING TOPICS ON UGANDAN POLITICS* on this forum because they have led to irresponsible engagement. 

We however appreciate everyone’s timely contributions on every issue. Therefore, the EXCO advises those who wish to continue political discussions to form another group. 

Thank you
Chairman
Executive Committee
03/09/2018, 08:49 - +60 17-272 2505: Noted with thanks

03/09/2018, 09:17 - +60 18-364 0070: Yeayy
03/09/2018, 09:17 - +60 16-475 8556: Thanks so much for your contribution towards the well being of Ugandan students here and for your good advise hope its not stepping on our freedom of speech on any topic in our and Malaysian constitution. we are sorry to whoever we told the truth and to those we affected in one way or the other..👋🏾👋🏾
03/09/2018, 09:20 - +60 11-5359 0769: Now which kind of group is this that prohibits pipo from discussing politics of their country?!! So they want us to discuss Malaysian politics or wat? Or they r trying to silence us... anyway noted... bt remember the world is surrounded with politics i guess sm of u r here bcz of politics regardless of which side u belong... mind u we belong to different professional fields meaning that we cant have a common topic on this platform... and trust me no one here in this current situation can spend a day without talking abt politics... *bt point noted*
03/09/2018, 09:26 - +60 11-5359 0769: Ndowooza ne group banatera giteekako tax😂😂
03/09/2018, 09:27 - +60 11-2803 7720: FYI, 
This group is not a political pressure group. Also, no one has been prohibited from openly talking about politics. 
The issue is that during such engagement  the language use is not in line with our core objectives. 
It is clearly noted that in case you want to continue such debate you can use another forum.
03/09/2018, 09:30 - +60 16-226 6917: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I hope people will understand. Creating another WhatsApp group takes just a few seconds.
03/09/2018, 09:30 - +256 755 911999: Hi brethren...well I remember before Bobi and everything guys here were super quiet. They say in order to maintain good conversation you should never discuss politics, religion and some other topic that has jumped out of my head... But I think that's possible when it's a two/ three people discussion. Banning the topic only goes to prove the kind of intolerance we speak of. We should be able to agree to disagree and still remain civil...after all we are all Ugandans and we are affected in one way or the other. 
 As much as I agree that people get out of hand... instead of sweeping the entire thing under the rug...let's be mature...if someone offends you call them out.. also it shows character of another person so instead of using abusive language let's remember that we represent ourselves,our parents our backgrounds and all that. 
That said there many other things to talk about.... I for one have been thinking of wealth creation... Kati who has some realistic pointers and people looking to get into partnerships... This place is a great place to network.... I have found some very intelligent people here that id like to work with.... Also for those in the job market especially here... Can you share tips on how to get in?
03/09/2018, 09:31 - +60 11-2803 7720: And it’s ok. 
In case the group isn’t inline with what you want, you are free to leave the group.
03/09/2018, 09:35 - +60 11-5359 0769: Hahahahaha... leero mweeee...
03/09/2018, 09:37 - +60 11-2803 7720: It is important to understand that not once, not twice, not thrice I have advised people to engage responsibly. 
A while ago, we openly agreed not to discuss issues of religion given the diversity of this group.
We should also understand that there exists political diversity in this group. I have noticed that some members have been openly attacking others because of their political orientation. Which I believe isn’t good.

Hurling insults and using offensive language in uncouth and intolerable.

03/09/2018, 09:49 - +60 11-2803 7720: The biggest problem is thinking that you are more important than others. 
In this group, every member is equally important. 
If you feel you are more Ugandan than us, it’s also ok. 

However we shall not tolerate indecency in our group. 
Thank you

That is the actual reason we created this group. 
The problem is thinking that everyone who Doesn’t agree with you is your enemy. 
I may be silent about my political orientation but that doesn’t make you understand me better.

Like I said, don’t judge me and don’t attack me me for what you even don’t know.

That is a behaviour not to be tolerated in case you want to enjoy harmonious living.

Kalungi, you were part in beginning this group. You know what the objective was. 

I don’t actually understand the prime reason you had to name tag me and insult me!

03/09/2018, 13:26 - +60 11-2803 7720: I understand your frustration Kamya. But you should also know that I also engage in these debates. 
But it is outrageous that people have failed to control themselves and people have failed to urge themselves out in a sensible and respectful manner. 
We are learned people and we have highly reputable people on this forum but sometimes, the choice of language especially when it comes to such topics hasn’t been lout. 

But like you cited me on advocating for free opinion, can you also cite how many times I have come out to advise guys to debate responsibly. 

Also, Mr. Kamya I think it’s wrong to fault people who started the group as to why they don’t contribute. As far as I know, you were added to this group in 2018. Do you think there wasn’t any one contributing prior to your joining? Of course there was. The question then should be, Why did they stop contributing? 

Listen, we all read the news and understand what’s happening in Uganda. Like you, we also know the news first hand. 
We are always updated but the level of interest learner that was being exhibited by some members of this group especially to people who disagree with their opinion is such intolerable. We have never experienced anyone attacking the other on this forum but it was happening. And I have come out on several times trying to tell people to use proper language.

Sometimes radical actions need radical decisions and that is why we came up with that.
03/09/2018, 14:08 - Eria Kamya: Ever since I joined this group, you've never referred us back to its main *topical* objectives. Why? And why did you have to wake up now? We've been discussing political issues for a considerable period. Why didn't you raise the issue all along that we had diverted from the group's objectives?

03/09/2018, 19:42 - +60 11-2803 7720: FYI, 
Mr. Kamya, the first person to comment on my Notice is Liz. 
Liz is a student in Limkokwing university and is in no way attached to the a Embassy. She doesn’t work or even have a relative at the Embassy.

Secondly, this group is not attached to the Embassy. I am happy to inform you that members of this group are students and others working but double as Alumni.

Mr. Kamya, it is regrettable to jump into conclusions without understanding the historical context of this group. 
This is not an Embassy group and the Embassy never even assisted in forming this group. 

If you have any issues you want to raise to the Embassy, members of this group can support you in that cause and advise you on what to do. But this isn’t a group formed by the Embassy. 

Lastly, I neither don’t want you to think we have stopped you from going to the Embassy, the Embassy is open for you Mr. Kamya you can visit them at your convenience and I know they are very willing to offer assistance to you.

As far as I know, NONE of them works at Embassy. 
I stand to be corrected.
03/09/2018, 20:17 - Eria Kamya: That's exactly enough 👍👍👍
03/09/2018, 20:18 - Eria Kamya: Only these?? 😅😅
03/09/2018, 20:18 - +60 11-2803 7720: Having people who work at the Embassy doesn’t mean she can’t be here. 
HE is here in the capacity of PATRON of the Association. 
All other embassy staff who are here are either Alumni or current students in the universities. 
Them working at the Embassy doesn’t disqualify them from being members of the Association.
03/09/2018, 20:19 - +60 11-2803 7720: The record is clear. You can check through!

03/09/2018, 20:23 - +60 11-2803 7720: Kalungi, no one has suppressed the girls issues. 
When I heard the audio, I may not have responded. But that doesn’t mean I didn’t take action. 
I did take action. And I forwarded the audio messages to the person I think will handle that case. 

Just because I didn’t write, it doesn’t mean none of us took action. 
We did, but we can’t come here and brag about it. 
There are so many people both girls and boys that have had issues and when they come to my attention, even when they are not members of this group I offer to help.
03/09/2018, 20:25 - +60 11-2803 7720: Mr. Kamya, I reiterate, this is NOT an Embassy WhatsApp group. 
The Embassy does not in any capacity interfere with what goes on in this group. 
Thank you.

03/09/2018, 20:57 - Eria Kamya: Please Mr Sadat, no one is forcing you to do anything. It's okay. We agree. First of all this group is not attached to the embassy, yet not only the embassy workers are on it but also HE herself. Secondly, the committee does things behind the scenes and doesn't communicate. In fact, it's not our concern. Thirdly, ever since I joined this group there was no other girl's issues but rather before I joined. Fourthly, political discussions are the cause of insults on this group, and that the *quiet* Committee unanimously agreed to ban political discussions here. etc

04/09/2018, 06:54 - +256 701 406572: Oh this is good information my bro David. Its world over not only Uganda that Embassies provide vital information not financial or other material resources. Even USA just gives advisory information to its citizens abroad. Its individual responsibility to put his stay in foreign country enjoyable. Personally, I benefitted a lot from our High Commission in KL to settle and study. We are in Information age and Embassy Information is vital and more than material help.
04/09/2018, 08:59 - Eria Kamya: Unfortunately in the same *information age*, people are still being prevented from expressing their free opinions. Otherwise you're implying that in this case, it's a one-way information flow process. 

In the same information age, people can not provide feedback in the name of *not wanting to brag*. 

Still in the same information age, an issue raised a while ago has just been responded to and moreover with an ordinary pdf that anyone can write. 

In the same information age, people could not express their dissatisfaction freely to the group, only to see them comment and applaud for the first time in a while after Sadat's announcement. I mean the quiet members. 

In the same information age, Sadat himself (or whoever is concerned) could not tell or remind the group of its core topical objectives for around a minimum of four months even when the group had for a long time diverted from the objectives. I personally think that such a reminder would have saved a lot. 

In the same information age, a committee which doesn't even give feedback can sit and unanimously agree to ban something without any prior warning. As if warning wouldn't be a form of information. 🤷‍♂ 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂

I think you guys should be ashamed of saying certain things and maybe try to cover them up.
04/09/2018, 09:29 - +60 16-475 8556: In the same information age one can only and only remember the core values of the group just bse he could no longer discuss the banned topics due to pressure from big reputable people masquerading in group...instead of telling us formally through a requisition character since it our freedom.

in the same manner he decides to ban the most influential and trending topic of politics...am sorry to say this but if in the house of God or Allah people or leaders themselves get misunderstandings and agree to disagree.now what of us whore are not even undertaking the speciality in the topics....
if parliamentarians can even fight over a matter in context ...eg in china..south S.frica. S.korea.Brazil.Uganda and others...what of us who just exchange salty vocabularies...then after we reconcile through ourselves interaction even in yo absentia?.

Always think before action if yo not pressured...think of gd and bad results...even use some diplomacy not just dictating...like a King..."I don't regret for that and I can never change my decision:..dats African Traditional Society....don't take on bad traits or genes of our current or previous leaders...they miscalculated and messed up our motherland that's y we are the leading producers of prostitutes in Asia...and most corrupt generation...in East Africa.👋🏾

I advised those guys to open another group and share the link. Anyone interested in discussing politics would simply follow. 

The guys simply resorted to hurling insults and charging everyone to believe that everything is politically motivated. And you believed! I ignored them because they are really naughty.

05/09/2018, 03:31 - +60 11-2803 7720: Did you read the NOTICE? 
No one has stopped you from talking about the Embassy or love or sex or dating. 
If you know about freedom of speech, then you should also know about contempt. 
Freedom of speech is not a fundamental right, there are reasonable limitations to freedom of speech. 
It’s like going to the church during a service but because you think you have the freedom of speech, you start insulting everyone around you during the service!
That is indecent behaviour!

05/09/2018, 14:10 - +60 17-364 3269: Am not threatning any one , am just commenting or is it now forbidden to comment  . U should stop threatning me . If u want to remove me do so , it’s not hard .n it won’t surprise me it’s simply typical way of acting .
05/09/2018, 14:10 - +60 18-364 0070: 🤣🤣🤣
05/09/2018, 14:12 - +60 18-364 0070: Hey chill...ain't got the powers to exit you...my point is if you want to exit, just press that button girl..no need to inform us..

I gave a complaint to the admin not to remove people just bse they said things they didn’t like . It’s not like they abused them or something . N I am not the only one who complained . All u had to to was to read the comment n pass by it . I don’t c y ur so touched by it

07/09/2018, 10:33 - +60 11-6111 5832: Hope you guys are doing well
07/09/2018, 10:34 - +60 11-6111 5832: This place has been silent since politis or what others refer to as politicking was “banned”
07/09/2018, 10:35 - +60 11-6111 5832: Well it was not really banned but the manner into which opinions were expressed
07/09/2018, 10:36 - +60 11-6111 5832: Away from that , permit me do a little takeover here; I promise to be brief
07/09/2018, 10:38 - +60 11-6111 5832: My name is imran
07/09/2018, 10:39 - +60 11-6111 5832: The aim of talking to you fellow ugandans is to spark a more engaging conversation
07/09/2018, 10:40 - +60 11-6111 5832: I will highlight a few items especially to allow our Ugandan community to grow
07/09/2018, 10:47 - +60 11-6111 5832: Growth I mean being able to engage in more research and business
07/09/2018, 10:54 - +60 11-6111 5832: By research I mean we can discuss particular issues that are in Malaysia and would be relevant as well as viable in Uganda, we assign a team or group of persons who have studied it here in Malaysia. They do extensive research and go to departments or industries that work directly with that particular issue (engineering, manufacturing, architecture, Islamic banking, modern urban city planning etc)
07/09/2018, 10:57 - +60 11-6111 5832: Then by Business , I mean we can engage in business opportunities here in Malaysia that involve mainly importing and exporting as well as setting up entrepreneurial activities. In this category there plenty of opportunities
07/09/2018, 10:57 - +60 11-6111 5832: Personally I am open to business 👌🏽
07/09/2018, 10:58 - +60 11-6111 5832: In that sense allow me refer to what happened to China recently when H.E Museveni was there

07/09/2018, 11:05 - +60 11-6111 5832: I got message from my Malaysian friends that the it’s good to get a compliment from our Asian people here. If they do , consider it really good
07/09/2018, 11:05 - +60 11-6111 5832: This sparked my intuition
07/09/2018, 11:06 - +60 11-6111 5832: I shared with the students and alumni committee that as the Ugandan community , we should aim to identify ourselves and set a name for ourselves
07/09/2018, 11:07 - +60 11-6111 5832: We are often called either Africans or Nigerians. This doesn’t go down quite well
07/09/2018, 11:08 - +60 18-364 0070: Through our dressing?
07/09/2018, 11:08 - +60 11-6111 5832: So as to create and set a name for uganda 🇺🇬 
We ought to be smart , formal and presentable and
07/09/2018, 11:09 - +60 11-6111 5832: Yes 
It’s one way. Because I will give an example
07/09/2018, 11:10 - +60 11-6111 5832: I went to a conference and one Dato asked where I was from, I told him Uganda and he was quick to tell me about his friends he studied with in Germany. They were smart and academically fine
07/09/2018, 11:12 - +60 11-6111 5832: So if we set a trend for being smart, formal, presentable we create a name for that. 
Fashion and design comes in different dimensions but it’s good to remain not far from formal and what is considered presentable
07/09/2018, 11:13 - +60 11-6111 5832: I can mention so many examples 
Ranging from one professor who said all his student ma from Uganda had performed well his classes
07/09/2018, 11:13 - +60 11-6111 5832: That’s a name for itself
07/09/2018, 11:15 - +60 11-6111 5832: So bottom line is we become good ambassadors for the good things because people are watching us
By doing so we set a name and we can be identified as Ugandans NOT as Africans or Nigerians ( because most of these people don’t care don’t know so they refer that way)
07/09/2018, 11:16 - +60 11-2340 3529: Thank you Mr. Imran. We have seen his excellence Bobi Wine... sorry i meant his excellence Yoweri tweeting about business in China... Sorry once againg if i included any political statement in my my statements above because i really dont want to politic...
07/09/2018, 11:17 - +60 11-6111 5832: Last but not least as I bow out,
This is a constructive criticism to the males and possibly to females but more to males:

One Chinese lady how happens to be my close friend 
Said that Africans, have this weird body odour. Well I took it in because she serious about it when I asked her for some details
07/09/2018, 11:20 - +60 18-364 0070: Now we are discussing personal hygiene? This is indeed funny🤣🤣🤣
07/09/2018, 11:20 - +60 11-6111 5832: So as Ugandan males let’s set the bar, let’s smell nice😄
Wear a good deodorant which goes for something like rm 15
This will also in the same line with smartness set a name that atleast Ugandans smell 👌🏽
07/09/2018, 11:21 - +60 11-6111 5832: Thank you for keeping tabs Mr Golooba
We can challenge ourselves here to aim for such and more
07/09/2018, 11:23 - +60 11-6111 5832: Well this is just a constructive criticism like I said Ms Halima. I am very sure u want your man or to be near someone who smells nice rather than that other odur
07/09/2018, 11:23 - +60 18-364 0070: This is very subjective and people are free to express themselves however they want fashion wise 🤔🤔🤔
07/09/2018, 11:24 - +60 11-6111 5832: Thanks for your permission guys to allow me takeover here. 
I am open to discuss more of this and more
07/09/2018, 11:25 - +60 11-6111 5832: Yes is agree with you but you should appreciate the objectivity in the generality of my point mentioned
07/09/2018, 11:28 - +60 18-364 0070: Hmmm... Now you're becoming some sorta parental figure telling people to shower and use deodorant? This is common knowledge...
07/09/2018, 11:52 - +60 11-6111 5832: Not really Ms Halima 
Just a friendly harmless reminder in context to my above mentioned views
07/09/2018, 11:59 - +60 18-364 0070: Cool...Halimah without the Ms. Is good enough

10/09/2018, 15:53 - +256 701 406572: That's the only think the media picked out of all good points discussed?
10/09/2018, 15:54 - +60 17-652 5256: What kind of ettiquette is that. Should we just ignore this?
10/09/2018, 15:56 - +256 755 911999: Unfortunately life is like that....you can do good things from Monday to Monday but the minute you do one bad thing....it's all people shall remember. And surely as the fountain of honour on national television....that's a NO NO.... atleast pretend like you've dropped a pen and bend .....but out there like that???
10/09/2018, 17:10 - +60 18-364 0070: Ewww...could this get any grosser? Hmmm

KAMPALA – The Supreme Court has overruled that all offences triable by magistrate’s courts can also be bailable in the same court

The five justices were responding to an appeal filed by a non-Governmental Organization (NGO) known as the Foundation for Human Rights Initiatives being with sections of the UPDF Act, Police Act and Magistrates Courts Act, which they felt contravened the constitutional provisions on liberty such as bail.

The organisation had asked Court to nullify section 14(2) of Trial on Indictment Act, section 75 of the Magistrates Courts Act and all the impugned provisions in the petition which are inconsistent with Articles 20, 23(1), 23 (6), 28(1) and 28(3) of the Constitution.

They had urged that the provision, contravenes Article 23 (6) of the Constitution (supra) in that it infringes and limits the accused’s right to apply for bail.

However in a majority Judgement read by Justice Esther Kisakye; their Lordships including the Chief Justice Bert Katureebe said that if an offence is triable by the Magistrate Court, it should be in position to grant bail.

The justices explained that it does not make sense for the magistrate’s court to handle the greater task of the case like trial, and not have power to handle the lesser task of granting bail.

The Justices have also concurred with the Constitutional court that ruled that the UPDF Act contravenes the Constitution in as far as detention of suspects for lengthy periods on remand is concerned.

“These acts violate the suspects’ right to fair and speedy trial as well as the presumption of innocence, a person should be detained for only a period of 48hrs as prescribed in the Law” they ruled.

However, on the issue of exceptional circumstances like, grave illness and advanced age; that are supposed to be proved by suspects charged with capital offences, before grant of bail; the 5 justices have ruled that this requirement does not take away his or her right to bail nor does it violate the Constitution but exceptional circumstances must be proved before release on bail.

Nile Post News by NILE POST NEWS   January 17, 2019
The Sembabule mess proves Museveni does not care about standards
Soldiers on duty
By Asuman Odaka

Although I’ve been opposing President Yoweri Museveni’s regime throughout my political life, only one aspect of his regime wins my emotion and protection; the professional men and women in uniform.

Whenever am driving on a highway and I detect a person in uniform by the roadside, I have always stopped my car and offered assistance whenever necessary, whether of lift or at least inquire if s/he needs any assistance.


ADVERTISEMENT

Anti riot police patrols Kampala streets on Monday.
I’ve also made it a policy that when in a PSV with a person in uniform, I pay his or her fare. I always feel they must be given priority in moments of peace because they make us a priority in times of danger. Therefore my soft heart for them has never made sense to some of my friends due to brutal treatment I have received from some of them a number of times as an activist. I wish to admit some of them many times behave insensitively and inhumanely especially during civic activities towards the civilians.

That not withstanding, they embody my security, they sign to die so that I live, they skip sleep so that I enjoy the comfort of my bed, I remember a traffic policeman I saw standing in a very heavy rain falling with hailstones so that I drive my car with convenience, the heat and dust have turned their white uniforms brown in the name of us moving with ease, they will guard the bank so that I withdraw my money to go and enjoy with my children without any attack yet many times when himself doesn’t have a coin and his children are hungry and out of school.

The intelligence will spend sleepless nights looking for any tip that would interrupt our daily schedules, they will take long to see their family just for us to stay with my own in peace.

Looking at this picture of one Kenyan police evacuating civilians encourages me to do even more good whenever I can to our men and women in uniform. Imagine all the people behind him, most likely have better education than him, are better paid than him, more respected in communities than him, more recognised than him, may have more accomplishments than him than him but in the face of this deadly danger, all their hope are on him, he is the ultimate shield for their bodies.

This is why I hate the politicians who lie to them about increasing their pay that never comes, who misuse them for their personal agenda, who mistreat them, eating as their guards are looking on, who give them wrong orders to beat the ordinary citizen etc.

This is why I despise their representatives in Parliament and elsewhere for failure to loudly and radically advocate for the best insurance schemes. In this regard I wish to give Idi Amin credit for recognizing a soldier’s child needs the best education and built schools, hospitals etc in barracks; a soldier’s families must have the best housing services because he sleeps out so that we sleep in houses. So atleast let their families enjoy as they protect us.

Even our democracy must be guaranteed by a strong security system or army.

Of course some will say that is the career they chose and that there more dangerious occupations in the world than army, but the difference is that for them the ultimate price they pay are their lives so that we live.

These and many others reasons are why we should love our brothers and sisters in uniform, we should protect them from this (sometimes) indecent contest of partisan politics. We should never allow anyone to treat them like his property, we should resist anybody who misuses them for his personal agenda.

We should name and isolate the bad apples that is amongst them. I hate with rage seeing a person putting in that revered uniform beating a journalist, a unarmed civilian or getting involved in this our divisive politics.


A UPDF soldier flogs one of protesters on Monday.
We should all agree as politicians and leaders that our men and women in uniform are so important for the survival, preservation of not just our present and but also our future.

I wish to salute all of you my dear brothers and sisters in uniform.

Bill Gates Dirty Tricks in Burkina Faso and Nigeria, by Sussy Vozniak, reporter for Intelicor Press, Vienna.  
 
Paris: Secret documents leaked on the fiasco in Burkina Faso expose troubling information on the undercover activities of the American Multi-Billionaire Bill Gates in the small African nation and across the region. Intelicor veterans in Paris express unease as the Burkinabe government led by Prime Minister Paul Kaba Thieba resigned  

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46930537
 
A leading Intelicor veteran thinks that the reason why President Roch Marc Christian Kabore demanded the resignation of the Prime Minister is related to the matter of the proposed release of genetically modified (GMO) mosquitoes in Burkina Faso under the sponsorship of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 

The story began in January 2018, when Bill Gates pledged USD $45 million to the health initiative in Burkina Faso. Some felt that the funds were a decoy to cover bribery to top government officials for allowing the program to release the GMO mosquitoes in Burkina Faso. The GMO mosquitoes were programmed at Imperial College London under a grant from Bill Gates to sterilize natural mosquitoes and humans across the African continent over time 

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/researchers-to-release-genetically-engineered-mosquitoes-in-africa-for-first-time/
 
The terrifying news of the secret project for Human Sterilization of Africans with GMO mosquitoes alarmed African leaders, who quickly came down hard on President Kabore forcing him to act. Similar teams are working in Mali and Uganda. The homing endonuclease gene (HEG) that sterilizes the female mosquitoes also could be passed through saliva to humans during bites and the human in turn could pass it on through sexual intercourse to another human, in a cascade that could have the entire Black Continent exterminated before anything could be done about it.  This is why 170 Global Groups called for Moratorium on the release of these new genetic extinction technology at the UN Convention 

http://www.etcgroup.org/content/160-global-groups-call-moratorium-new-genetic-extinction-technology-un-convention
 
The GMO mosquitoes were moved into Burkina Faso from UK illegally under EU regulations 
http://www.genewatch.org/uploads/f03c6d66a9b354535738483c1c3d49e4/GM_mosquitoes_in_Burkina_Faso_final.pdf

Ànd fresh evidence from trials in Cayman Islands, Panama and Brazil show that the Oxitec’s GM mosquitoes failed to reduce the female mosquitoes  population 

https://gmwatch.org/en/news/latest-news/18275-new-evidence-of-failure-of-oxitec-s-gm-mosquito-trials

It goes to reinforce what critics have always said, that it is not about the mosquitoes but about making people sterile.

Investigations revealed that, of the $45 million dollars pledged by Bill Gates, $10 million dollars were earmarked for family planning 
https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/gates-pledges-45-million-for-health-initiatives-in-burkina-faso
 
In the secret deal, the Minister of Health of Burkina Faso Professor Nicolas Meda  appointed the wife of the Prime Minister Anne Thieba as ambassador for family planning 

https://www.advancefamilyplanning.org/burkina-faso-appoints-her-excellency-anne-thieba-ambassador-family-planning

And so she has authority over the funds. However, some say that “it is to keep it within the family”, that raised the smoking gun prompting in-depth investigation by President Kabore and could have exposed the comprising evidence against Prime Minister Thieba. The Intelicor veteran said “in all cases, we see a pattern, that Bill Gates uses monetary bribes disguised as philanthropic donations to compromise African leaders, to take actions with devastating consequences for their nations”.  

The HIDDEN AGENDA is usually not fully understood by the African leaders the source continues. According to a business consultant who has been involved in tracking Bill Gates’ investments in biotechnology, the main focus for Bill Gates is to have the controlling shares in the biotechnology companies for food production sold in Africa as GMO crops. With partners such as Monsanto (now under the German company Bayer with a troubled Nazi past

https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/bayer-monsanto-merger-cant-erase-nazi-chemists-past/
 
Bill Gates will control the food security and polity of Africa and could at any moment exterminate the Black Africans in the Continent as his partners did in Vietnam and Auschwitz with agent Orange and Chlorine Gas. Bill Gates used pseudo-names Boko Haram in Nigeria and Al-Shabab (formaerly unknown local Islamic groups with tens of followers) in Kenya to bring Black Africa’s fastest growing populations to a standstill. Boko Haram, Al-Shabab and ISIS are all funded by Bill Gates and were trained by Blackwater

http://www.pravdareport.com/business/companies/14-10-2010/115363-machines_of_war_blackwater_monsanto_billgates-0/
 
The Western governments are culprits in the crime, until the coming of Donald Trump the U.S. was the main sponsor in partnership with Bill Gates! Bill Gates owns the majority shares in Monsanto/Bayer 

http://naturalsociety.com/big-owner-monsanto-shares-bill-gates-depopulation-agenda-exposed/
 
For example, Bill Gates’ acquisition of Ginkgo a $1 billion USD biotech company in Boston MA that prints DNA for GMO crops https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/21/bill-gates-backed-start-up-ginkgo-bioworks-prints-synthetic-dna.html will give him control over the food security in Africa, should the continent go GMO. Africans would not out of free-will give up their natural crops for GMOs except if they are forced to do so. An agronomist Anaïs Étienne says Africans would be left without choice because all the fields are being cleared by Boko Harma fighters and their farmers driven out to displaced people camps and would be given GMO crops to plant during rehabilitation through NGOs and UN organisations supported by the Gates Foundations. 

Ismail Kadir, a real estate agent in Maiduguri, Nigeria says “all my foreign clients operating NGOs are taking rents for 5 to 10 years and I ask them what would they be doing here in ten years, if they do not think that the insurgency would last that long”. Bill Gates is operating a special type of business philanthropy, whereby the aim is to create the problem of insurgency and offer the solution with GMO crops which will guarantee him as the main supplier of seeds and hence food, then grow it into a business worth $1 trillion USD by 2030 

https://howwemadeitinafrica.com/seizing-africas-rapidly-growing-food-market-worth-1tn-2030/59729/
 
On the other hand, Claudia McAnthony a reproductive health expert on sabbatical in an elite laboratory in Paris says “making Africans sterile would mean their women would go for invitro-fertilization (IVF) to seek for help to conceive, but their ovarian eggs would be poached for embryonic stem cell research as young Africans are killed for experiments in European and American laboratories of companies seeking to clone human organs for sale, a business worth over $30 trillion USD by 2030”. 

Nigeria and Kenya supply most of the ovarian eggs used in embryonic stem cell research in Europe and America, only to leave the donors die slowing in Africa from kidney failure, liver failure, cancers and infections. It is convenient for Bill Gates to hire for the crimes against humanity, people posing as Islamists paid in US dollars through proxies and blame it on Islamic fundamentalists. Bill Gates shows up frequently for photo-ops on Polio with African leaders and leaves donations to feed the corrupt practices in the continent. The Polio program has been a very big cover for Bill Gates as the good man from America, while he uses it to facilitate clandestine operations including administering sterilizing agents 

https://www.lifesitenews.com/new/unicef-nigeria-polio-vaccine-contaminated-withsterilizing-agents-scientis
 
And using the vehicles marked as vaccination team to convey Boko Haram fighters beyond military checkpoints. The process began since 2009 in the food growing region of Northeast Nigeria. 

The mercenaries hired first from Liberia 

https://www.counterpunch.org/2009/04/06/blackwater-in-liberia/

Sierra-Leone, and later from Libya, Chad, Niger, by Blackwater/Academie/Xe owned by Bill Gates and Monsanto/Bayer 

https://www.voltairenet.org/article179691.html

Fighters are paired $10,000 a month as Boko Haram fighters in Nigeria (https://www.voanews.com/a/a-13-2009-03-06-voa39-68678567/408730.html ) by Bill Gates. The Boko Haram attacks will intensify as the elections in Nigeria draws near as it is now clear Bill Gates is supporting the opposition leader Atiku Abubakar who he could convince to allow GMO crops in Nigeria. In a recent visit to the U.S facilitated by Bill Gates, at a time there is a government shutdown it is clear Atiku Abubakar was not welcome anywhere within the US government and US Congress, but for a publicity stunt, and an opportunity to seal up the deal with Bill Gates in person.  Atiku Abubakar has been barred from the U.S. pending US Congressional investigation on corrupt practices by him and his family in the United States from Nigeria

https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/download/report-psi-staff-report-keeping-foreign-corruption-out-of-the-united-states-four-case-histories
  
Many experts expect Bill Gates to sponsor dramatic Boko Haram attacks aimed at embarrassing the government of President Buhari of Nigeria and to help the opposition

https://www.thenigerianvoice.com/news/274825/us-warns-of-plan-by-boko-haram-to-carry-out-terrorist-attack.html

Some think that Bill Gates using his Boko Haram mercenaries have planned attacks with aim of assassinations of top officials to demonstrate to Nigerians that their government is weak on security. The government of Burkina Faso has been in partnership with the US government under the Obama administration and Bill Gates, and provided its territory for U.S. military bases for training of the top mercenaries for Boko Haram to fight in Nigeria. 

Some have suggested that, Bill Gates and George Soros financed the coup in Burkina Faso in 2015 to maintain these military bases for sponsorship of the insurgency in Nigeria and for destabilization of the entire West African region 

https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2015/09/21/did-africom-engineer-military-coup-in-burkina-faso.html

The Bill Gates sponsored Jihadists have now turned against the Burkinabe government as relations soured because of pressure from African leaders  (https://m.news24.com/Africa/News/13-dead-in-burkina-faso-after-suspected-jihadist-attack-20190102 ). There is growing dissatisfaction among African leaders with actions of Bill Gates on the African Continent. Even more distressful is the connivance with leaders of Western Countries like France, Germany and Britain, who have collaborated in the destabilization of Africa. 

The growing popularity of China is a direct reflection of the feeling of unease in African capitals that the entire Western countries have gone rouge. According to Laurent Kosic, a political analyst in Paris, who has lived for over a decade in Africa, said “ this is typical of Africa, they would rather avoid you than pick a fight, but what they need now is a total ban of genetically modified organisms across the continent”. “The effort by Bill Gates to sterilize the entire black people of Africa with GMO foods and GMO mosquitoes all fits well with UNFPA targets to depopulate the continent and provide a means for perpetual colonialism” – he added.

The watch is on as President Kabore names Christophe Dabire as the new prime minister, but the last is yet to be heard from the events unravelling in Burkina Faso.

15/03/2019, 16:47 - +60 10-767 0113: Boeing 737 Max 
Engineering Point of View 

157 people recently died in a tragic crash. The crew and passengers of Ethopian Air ET-302 on board a brand new Boeing 737 MAX 8 never had a chance. 

The less than Brand New plane had a new software in it. They called it MCAS or Maneuvering Chracteristics Augmentations System. MCAS was a system that didn't exist in any of the Boeing 737's before. However, when they built the 737 MAX version, in layman's term, they built the plane with a larger and more efficient engine. 

However, this larger engine, which delivered a further 14% fuel efficiency had to be fitted further forward under the low wings of the 737. This potentially may cause the plane to stall. Stalling is bad. It is basically when a plane stops flying and starts falling. 

In order to avoid this, Boeing installed the new MCAS software. This software is designed to tell the plane to move its nose down to increase its speed and avoid it from stalling. 

So here comes the problem. 

In the computer world, we have this term called GIGO. The old school fella's will know this. Yes. Garbage In, Garbage Out. 

The problem based on the findings so far is this. 

On the plane there is a sensor called the Alpha Vane which measures the Angle of Attack (AOA) of the plane. It looks like a small little wing, and they have two of it, one on the pilot side, and the other on the co-pilot's. 

The sensor's job is to tell the computer the angle the plane is flying at. And if the AOA of the plane is too high, this will result in the plane stalling. Typically the AOA is below 15 to 20 degrees, and the new MCAS software will push the plane's nose down if it thinks that the AOA is too high. 
 
No one knew what was really wrong with the plane, or about the new MCAS software. No one. Not the maintenance folks, and in fact not even the pilot. He apparently wasn't trained on it yet.

So they flew the plane. 

And once in the air, the faulty sensor told the computer that the plane is stalling. The computer then, without the pilot ever knowing pushed the nose of the plane down further, while the pilot was trying to raise the plane. 

In this battle between the pilot and the computer, the computer won. And the pilot, the crew, and the passengers lost and they died. The plane was too low, and the pilot didn't have enough air to raise the plane and fly it. 

The computer literally flew the plane , one of the way to stop the computer was to switch it off!

Apparently 157 lives could have been saved, had the pilot knew about the software, and flipped a switch to turn it off. 

A switch! 

A single simple switch was the difference between life and death. 

I am still fuming thinking about this. A switch!

Listening to the eulogy of Mrs Esther Nsibambi at Namirembe Cathedral yesterday,  I realised the humility of a civilian woman that appreciates a soldier. She thanked so many people for their support to her deceased husband during his sickness and when it came to their bodyguard called Okello and another one whose name I can't recall now, she had to repeat in order to emphasise her point. Several others would probably have stopped at mentioning relatives and friends. I felt proud of her.

09/06/2019, 12:22 - +60 10-767 0113: Russian President Vladimir Putin hits Africa Again!

"Africa will never be independent, Africans believe in Europeans, Americans, and Chinese more than themselves. They don't trust themselves at all, African technocrats/Engineers aren't given the platform to practice what they studied instead they hire Chinese to construct roads for themselves.

A white man will commit a crime in Africa but no action will be taken because the African authorities view us as Demigods, far from the truth. A black man can be abducted in Europe get harassed and even be killed but no African authority can even question. Africans present themselves as weak people with no hope, especially when dealing with Europeans and Americans.

They are their own enemies. They hate each other and this gives their colonial masters the opportunity to continue exploring their resources. As far as I know, Africa is more of God's chosen continent, its a blessed continent and its time for Africans to Realise they are in a place where Americans, Europeans and Chinese are jealous of and wish it should be them there...You can't compare African weather with any other weather...African soil can feed the whole of Europe, America, and Asia but their problem is just one, "THEIR LEADERS". As far as I am concern their best president ever was Gaddafi".

To me, it is left to the Africans to forget the emotion and try to understand the challenges attracting all these insults (though it not actually an insult but a reality). Keep shame and unnecessary pride aside, analyze the situation and think of what to do.

Please do share these articles to others; not to make fun, mockery or entertainment, but to create further awareness within our society. Let the end-time of God not meet us in this state of inferiority and less significance on our own God-given continent.

I am an African, I love Africa, But I Wish Africa Should Change.

                                                                There are 2 types of Laws of finance:
1} LAW OF POVERTY.
2} LAW OF WEALTH.


*1} LAW OF POVERTY:* This law states that work alone or work under someone and remain poor for the rest of your life. 95% of people in the world are living under this law. The people under this law make use of their credentials, they have ego, they seek for job, they have someone called boss, they receive salary which is fixed amount.

*S.A.L.A.R.Y*
S= Small
A= Amount
L= Limiting
A= And
R= Restricting
Y= You

These people are called the working class. They always look for job.

*J.O.B*
J= Just
O= Over
B= Broke


*2} LAW OF WEALTH:* This law states that work with a team or group of people and remain wealthy forever, it is just 5% of people in the world that are living under this law. The people under this law make use of their potentials, and they are called the thinking class, they think of what to offer to the society and in turn make money. These people they earn their money which is income and it is not a fixed amount. These people are called the thinking class.


_The difference between these laws is that the people under the_ *LAW OF POVERTY* _don't make use of opportunity.. while those under the_ *LAW OF WEALTH* _make use of any opportunity that comes their way. The wealthy ones make use of *ID Number* and also *Partnership,* they have what is called big dreams but the poor don't have._

 *REMEMBER THESE TODAY*
👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼

Money does not respond to qualifications
Otherwise the wealthiest people should have been *Ph.D holders.*

Money does not respond to age Otherwise the world's oldest twins would have been the *richest.*

‍ It is not about your *degree*
 It is all about what you do after the *degree.*

‍Have you noticed that the 1st class degree holders are not the *Richest* 
Neither are the *3rd class degree holders the poorest.* 
There is more to being wealthy than education.

The most important thing is *Mindset* 👌 and the next thing is a *Commitment to self DISCIPLINE.*

The only person holding your key to success is *YOU.*

The secrets to success is for you to be willing to pay the price but the challenge is that very few are ready and willing to pay the price to succeed.

While some are partying and gisting, others are learning, planning and earning.

Don't sit down and complain about where you are, it won't change anything.

If you must see changes, the person that must change is *You*.

Be assured... *YOU HAVE ALL IT TAKES TO Succeed,* learn to invest  the little you have and get a mentor to teach you how to grow your money.

*REMEMBER...*
There are two kinds of pain:
*PAIN OF REGRET*😔😩😭
*PAIN OF SUCCESS*💃🏽🤸🏽‍♀🤝🏼🥇💰❤⭐💯🎓

25/06/2019, 12:47 - +256 701 406572: It was clearly a quite broad plot, but its coordination must have been off. Police are still rounding up suspected plotters, and Abiy Ahmed was still prime minister on Monday.

Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is a very lucky man. He has survived three attempts to kill or overthrow him in the past year.

Last June he escaped unhurt in a grenade attack that killed one and wounded scores at a political rally. In October his office in the capital, Addis Ababa, was surrounded by angry soldiers who threatened to kill him over low pay, but he talked them down. And last Saturday he emerged unscathed from an attempted military coup. 

It was a very serious attempt. In the capital, General Se’are Mekonnen was shot dead by his own bodyguard, as was another general who was visiting his home. Abiy had made Se’ are the chief of staff of the Ethiopian army, a controversial appointment, only a year ago.

At the same time another of Abiy’s appointees, Ambachew Mekonnen, the governor of the key Amhara region, was murdered together with his top adviser in the region’s capital, Bahir Dar.

It was clearly a quite broad plot, but its coordination must have been off. Police are still rounding up suspected plotters, and Abiy Ahmed was still prime minister on Monday.

That is a very good thing because Abiy Ahmed is Ethiopia’s best chance of breaking the cycle of tyrannies that have blighted its modern history. It is Africa’s second-biggest country (102 million people) and one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, but its politics have been cursed.

In the past century, it has gone from a medieval monarchy to rule by foreign fascists (it was conquered by Mussolini’s Italy in the 1930s), and then back to an only slightly less medieval tyranny for another thirty years – until a Marxist-led military coup in 1974.

The ‘Derg’ junta murdered the emperor and half a million other Ethiopians – mostly the better-educated ones – in a ‘Red Terror’ that fell short of the Khmer Rouge’s ‘killing fields’, but not by much. Then, after almost two decades, the Soviet Union collapsed, the foreign aid to the Communists stopped, and the Reds were overthrown in their turn in 1991.

The victor that time was a coalition of ethnic rebel groups, militarised and brutalised by a long guerilla war against the Derg, who slid quickly into the seats of power and remained there comfortably until last year. The political killings declined, but the tyranny they protected did not – until suddenly, last year, they handed the whole mess over to Abiy Ahmed. 

They did so because the mess was getting out of hand. Ethiopia is a very complicated country: four major ethnic groups, all of which have fought each other in the course of the country’s long history, and a litter of smaller ethnic groups as well. The country is also divided between a Christian majority and a big Muslim minority.

To make matters worse, one of the larger ethnic groups, the Tigrayans, dominated the military and intelligence services, and therefore the regime as a whole – and there was no shred of democracy anywhere in the system.

There were pro forma elections, but in the last ones, in 2015, not a single opposition candidate won a seat in parliament. 

The longer the Tigrayans dominated at the centre, the more unpopular the federal government became, and meanwhile the country’s relentless population growth intensified the land disputes between rival ethnic groups.

Since 2015 some 3 million Ethiopians have become internal refugees, mainly due to struggles over land.

So in April 2018, in desperation, the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front handed the prime ministership over to Abiy Ahmed. 

Abiy is certainly a ‘child of the Party’, which he joined at 15, but he is a reformer who can be all things to all people.

His father was Muslim, his mother was Christian. As an Oromo, he comes from the lowest rungs of the Ethiopian ethnic pecking order. (No Oromo has ever held such high office before.) He is fluent in Afaan Oromo, Amharic, Tigrinya and English. And he is a very modern man.

He knew he had to move fast, so he immediately ended the state of emergency and changed almost all the senior military commanders. He appointed a cabinet that was half-female, plus women as president and as head of the Supreme Court.

He released thousands of political prisoners. He freed the media, made the leader of an opposition party head of the Electoral Board, and put her in charge of organising free elections in 2020.

He made peace and re-opened the border with Eritrea after 20 years of the hot and cold war. He has done pretty well everything he could think of, and he did it in little over a year. And yet he is still in a very precarious position

.

It could not be otherwise. He is trying to free a big, complex, traumatised country from a century of dreadful history, and the odds, of course, are against him. But he’s not down yet.

07/10/2019, 19:59 - +256 701 406572: I spent a total of 14 years in diaspora and the person who made me relocate to Kenya is a white man. 
   
He asked me why i was in Europe and as the norm i wripped Kenya apart saying all the negative i could, blaming the Government etc. After hearing me speak for a long time he told me i was stupid. I was angry but he explained why.

Firstly he said is he could swap my rural land in Kenya he would give me his 4 bedroom house in Yorkshire. A direct swap. I thought that was stupid. But he explained.

The two most important forms of capital are land and human capital.  He said you are lucky to have free rural land inherited from ancestors. In UK just 50m2 you pay through the nose. Why not utilise that land. Whats stopping you. Use every inch of it. Farm on it, keep animals, do rural tourism, open a factory. Just do something. Forget about the land taken from whites. 

He opened my eyes. It took me a flight thousands of miles away from home and years way to realise the opportunity i left home . Its the mindset. We need to change

 I will give you a simple example. A village in Kenya will have about 30 families. Each family with 10 cows. 

If those madhalas came together and registered a consortium those cows put together are 300. Thats a ranch right there. This entity will make them create generational wealth. They can challenge Colcom , Koala, Surrey etc. In a few years they can have abattoirs, electrify their homes, sink boreholes and resuscitate their roads.

As sum of parts is ONE. Our challenge is we focus on the wrong things. We talk about he he i dont have capital. I dont think so.

In Kenya you get the husband driving a USD 15 000 car and the wife a USD 6 000 car. Tvs worth 1000s, fridges worth 1000s. Yet these will tell you we dont have capital to start a business or farm. Yet they have all that dead capital lying around.

The cost of landing a Toyota Harrier is enough to start a serious project on your rural home. A project that will employ the community and help build the economy. 

Forget about the Government and politics . We are on our own. No one is coming back for us. It either we build a raft and sail off the island or die there sulking.

This message from:
Mr. Khalid Javed Alkhaili 

Based : London
Position : Senior Nursing Officer 

*AVOID EATING AGRIC CHICKEN BONES*
*PLEASE IF YOU DECIDE TO DIE, DIE OF ANYTHING BUT IGNORANCE*
*STOP CHEWING CHICKEN BONES BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE POISON LIES IN THE BONE*

Avoid eating chicken wings frequently - ladies, especially; 
*a true story*...!
A friend of mine recently had a growth in her womb and she underwent an *operation to remove the…. The cyst removed was filled with dark colored blood.* She thought that she would recover after the surgery but! She was terribly wrong.

A relapse occurred just a few months later. Distressed, she rushed down to her gynecologist for a consultation.
During her consultation, *her doctor asked her a question that puzzled her. He asked if she was a frequent consumer of chicken wings and she replied yes wondering as to how he knew of her eating habits.* You see, the truth is in this modern day and age; *chickens are injected with steroids to accelerate their growth so that the needs of this society can be met.*

This need is none other than the need for food. 

*Chickens that are injected with steroids are usually given the shot at the neck or the wings.*
Therefore, it is *in these places that the highest concentration of steroids exists.* These steroids have terrifying effects on the body as it accelerates growth..

*It has an even more dangerous effect in the presence of female hormones, this leads to women being more prone to the growth of a cyst in the womb.*

Therefore, I advise the people out there to watch their diets and to lower their frequency of consuming chicken wings!

People, who receive this message *please forward it to your friends and loved ones.* I am sure no one wants to see him or her suffer!😳😰💦(Copied / Sent as received)

02/11/2019, 22:10 - +256 701 406572: In USA, Afro Americans are battling with state authorities not to discriminate certain Afro heir styles.

02/11/2019, 23:17 - +60 11-2803 7720: It’s true. Women don’t need validation  from men. 
BUT
As member of the same society in which we live harmoniously, each of us is entitled to their opinion and it’s good to respect it!

I add my voice to the Dr. I also don’t like when black women use extensions and wigs to look like white people instead of appreciating their natural beauty.

And picking a leaf from yesterdays training - I'm availing my brain for harvesting as far as identifying pain-points would be concerned.

24/11/2019, 08:57 - +60 10-767 0113: History has taught us Coming to power early and without experience carries serious risks

1. Napoleon came to power in France at age thirty. Invaded Europe. Was defeated at age 46 and jailed. He died in jail aged 52.
2. Samuel Doe came to power in Liberia at age 28. He couldn't run the country. He subcontracted the running of the country to a foreign country.
3. Yayah Jammeh came to power in Gambia at age 29. He couldn't handle the opposition. He reinstated the death sentence to deal with opponents.
4. Mengistu Haile Mariam came to power in Ethiopia aged about 32. He couldn't handle the opposition and plunged the country into a civil war that resulted in Eritrea breaking away. Mengistu was defeated and fled into exile
5. Mikhail Sakaashville became president of Georgia at age 36. He tried to solve a problem of two areas that had broken off forcing Russian military to occupy Georgia.
6. Francisco Madero aged 37 forced the Mexican president out of the country. Madero became president. Without experience he couldn't run the country and control the military. After 13 months in power he, his brother and vice president were assassinated. The country fell into a civil war or revolution for ten years that killed some 2 million people.
Any lessons?
24/11/2019, 09:32 - +60 12-868 2549: Lesson: Those were their times. We're living in a different and  a completely unconventional space, that has proved to bring about disruptively good results. 
So, i believe having Young or Old leaders in power doesn't matter today & now, what matters though is their ability to challenge the status quo and take on the uncertainity & dynamic society we live in.
24/11/2019, 10:16 - +60 12-868 2549: What we can learn from history though is the success of any regime is to a large extent  dependent on the intelligence, and brain capacity ( how good is such a leader's brain in learning, and adapting to changing times in pursuit of common goals for his or her people) and spiritual blessedness ( _yes, some leaders are divinely destined_. On this note we may observe that the intelligence of a father is not directly proportional to that of the son or daughter and vice versa; hence the reason why certain young leaders failed where their fathers had succeeded. 

Also the reason (in my opinion) why certain monarchies where powerful than others whereas in other regions a change of political system was necessary ( to 
authoritarian, totalitarian and democracy ( _of varying forms_)) in order to strengthen the country or region. 

Note: I'm neither a history major nor a politician, just simple opinions of a common man on the sidelines😉

12/12/2019, 19:20 - +60 12-868 2549: This is URA Tower is located in Nakawa, a neighbourhood within the city of Kampala, approximately 6 KM (4 mi), by road, east of the city center.

The building rises 22 floors above ground, with usable space of 26,021 square metres (280,088 sq ft). Maximum occupancy is calculated at 1,700 people.

There is provision for underground parking for 360 cars, and surface parking for 710 vehicles.

The parking structure measures 12,923 square metres (139,102 sq ft), on 5 levels for parking and the sixth level designed with space for a breastfeeding centre for staff.

It was constructed by the M/S Seyani Brothers & Co Uganda Ltd and the process took 5 years. It is designed to be green with an Intelligent Building Management System (BMS) thus making it a high-performance building.
12/12/2019, 19:23 - +60 12-868 2549: If our tourism is focused on developments and sites that show a bright future - then we will ursher in a new breed of tourists interested in our space, working with us and understanding our culture. 

The story of wild life is good but its as old as the planet earth
12/12/2019, 19:37 - +60 18-364 0070: Hmmm🤔🤔🤔
12/12/2019, 19:44 - +60 12-868 2549: Well, this is only my opinion - 
The logic here is that the entire world has known Africa for being the "wild life center" since ages and although there many people who would want to know more about Africa today, they're scared. 
So how about changing the story.
12/12/2019, 19:57 - +60 18-364 0070: There is a huge on going debate about global warming and its diverse negative effects on life inclusive of wild life. If Africa and Uganda is still blessed wild life, it's a positive thing. But what do I know?
12/12/2019, 20:01 - +60 12-868 2549: 🤔 that's a great insight too
12/12/2019, 23:36 - +256 701 406572: Very good ideas. People go to Monaco to watch old architecture while in Africa, only animals

17/12/2019, 00:54 - +60 12-868 2549: And then there comes new faces and new roles, new KPIs.
17/12/2019, 01:17 - +60 12-868 2549: This morning i have woken up with a revelation - that Ugandans we should learn to hold accountable these people appointed to key & strategic posts, paid to deliver; instead of blaming the president or the thinking that "government == the president" and thus the performance of these people, is the president's. The president appoints them, assigns them tasks/roles and gives me power - Qn. Do they fulfill those tasks ? And what do they do with that power? 

So, does it matter who is president? Is a country's development entirely limited or constrained by the ability, intentions & vision of the president? - Food for thought! 
In a nutshell, If Uganda needs a change it has to be the our civic mindset, our values, our commitment to our nation; such that if given an opportunity to serve, no matter who - that person will have the intent to deliver for the general good of all.
17/12/2019, 02:32 - +60 17-234 7760: “Does it matter who is the president” really.. ! 
I agree with you and any one in the leadership role should be held accountable *not excluding my dear president* 
He is the 1st to be held accountable as he picks his team to deliver his ambitions or vision.. so when you say “does not matter who is president “ am torn apart. When CEO for an under performing multinational fails to delivers to the shareholders they fire the CEO not the CFO or VP. 
Same applies to a country.. when we the share holders(citizens) demand... 😂let me stop there.. 
good point though.
17/12/2019, 03:01 - +60 12-868 2549: Thank you for your insight bro! Of course the CEO is key -- 
But hey, what is the role of the Prime Minister ? I thought that was the equivalent of the CEO 🤔
17/12/2019, 03:25 - +60 12-868 2549: @60172347760 when you look at the profiles of ministers we have had in history up to date -- they come from all professions and levels of intellectual ability (Professors, Engineers, Doctors, Philosophers, psychologists, Accountants, Soldiers, Police officers, ... ) Very very few have resigned or rejected the offer on grounds of compromise -- which is what happens in MNCs -- staff who know what they are doing professionally, work hard to deliver and show results and sometimes convince the CEO/ Or board of Directors using their technical acumen or craftiness on good policies, on what works -- which i think if every high level civil servant had the intent, would do as well.   

Ministry of ICT - is an example of excellent performance in my opinion and observation. in three years (2016-2019) down the line - uganda's ICT landscape is somewhere in Africa despite a few set backs.
17/12/2019, 06:46 - +60 11-2803 7720: How can you hold someone accountable when there are no structures to aid that! 
Ugandans hold these people accountable through our elected Parliament but the parliament also houses a bunch of “useful idiots” (google that term) who breach our trust in them. 
Secondly, there is no such a thing as integrity in Uganda. No one in Uganda be it Ministers air even public servants are willing to accept wrongdoing or even apologise to the nation! 

Lastly, it seems we rank low on civility! Because it’s something we don’t see growing up, we end up not transferring the skills to Workplaces. As such most of Uganda’s public and civil servants like most of the general population lack the basic civility and this affects ethics, integrity and overall work ethic. 
I beg to move!
17/12/2019, 10:35 - +60 12-868 2549: Thank you @601128037720  - this is quite a thorough analysis!
17/12/2019, 11:20 - +60 12-868 2549: 🤔  Structures are needed and a change of culture , not necessarily the person of the president - So given @601128037720 analysis, shall we ever be able to save ourself from us ? Or 
1. We let Time determine our fate, as our civilization comes along with new generations born , while old minds/old beliefs/ corrupt ways fade
2. Continue to do what we have always done - practise a form of democracy, until its perfect enough to work for our environment.
3. Become the first country in history to outsource its leadership to a foreign party/force or agent  having the necessary expertise,  that would come in to implement the change we lack, and handover when the environment (people) are ready - a wilful occupation!
17/12/2019, 11:22 - +60 11-6111 5832: Number 3 is so funny 😜
17/12/2019, 11:23 - +60 12-868 2549: _*@ Political scholars on this group, where are you ? We wanna hear your opinions too*_
17/12/2019, 11:23 - +60 12-868 2549: Oh yes, its the CRAZY ONE !! ☝️
17/12/2019, 11:24 - +60 11-6111 5832: To change the narratives. We ought to get back to civil service. Leave army out of politics or power.
They are a different animal when it comes to power.
17/12/2019, 11:27 - +60 11-6111 5832: I saw a submission of one person on twitter comparing Singapore cabinet and Uganda. The lot in Singapore are well educated in the first class world universities. With both integrity and will to work for the country.

Meanwhile in Uganda, mzee has a lot to pay for comrades in luwero, the promises he has not fulfilled and as well save his face from the crimes he has comitted. That makes him want to stay on even when he knows time is running out
17/12/2019, 11:30 - +60 11-6111 5832: Lack of structures, not being accountable just like sadat and kasolo mentioned earlier.  In fact if u or me entered this government and didn't "eat" our people who kill us themselves why we don't. Or even the "mafia" within will eliminate those who try to do good
17/12/2019, 11:32 - +256 775 371125: Globalisation has created governance gap in our democracy.
All you discussing draws no solutions
17/12/2019, 11:36 - +256 775 371125: Our culture was lost @ the expense of westernisation and then you are demanding moral authority  now?
17/12/2019, 11:37 - +60 11-6111 5832: More harm has been done than good. That's Why people lost confidence in polls, education system led to high unemployment. I pity the next government. Has a lot to do. Mzee leaves nothing or little to build on. The longer he stays without proper planning. Even his nrm will perish within few years
17/12/2019, 11:43 - +60 12-868 2549: But Guys @601161115832  , what do you say of these cabinet profiles - dont you think the president over time he has given chance to intellectuals ( & even non- soldiers) upto the level of vice president, and several other ministries for example Energy ( Engineers), Health ( Doctors) , and others and yet undesirable outcomes  continue 🤔
17/12/2019, 11:58 - +60 12-868 2549: Thank you @256775371125  
True, Globalization has had an impact to our culture. 
But hey , we live in a global society today which is an innevitable force to reckon with & comply to. Otherwise, what shall we do without our global partners ( donors, trade relations, well wishers, etc) - so compromise is necessary 😉 
I see your point here which brings me to this qn. Is our problem internally or externally influenced ? Have we been used?
17/12/2019, 12:07 - +60 11-6111 5832: I tell u there more well capable and educated fellas than those. Look at cabinet of Rwanda.
17/12/2019, 12:07 - +60 12-868 2549: Oh yes,.. the war victims ; i'm one of them . I was born during the war and so never had enough sleep due to gun shots every night as a baby hence distorting my childhood. Mzee has to pay me too // Generally this list will never be exhausted. After paying people, environmentalists will come and say - Mzee you need to compesate the monkeys which were killed during the war
17/12/2019, 12:14 - +60 12-868 2549: You mean more educated than 
1. Prof Gilbert Bukenya
2. Prof Apollo Nsibambi (late)
3. Eng Irene Muloni 
4. Eng D'ujanga simon
5. Dr Muyingo John Chrysostom
6. The list goes on & on 
And moreover, these have been educated on tax payers money
17/12/2019, 12:14 - +256 775 371125: @sadat told you institutuons and their operators lost civility.ugandans lost social trust in their leadership this brings us into living in a chaotic state. People are nolonger intrested in institutions,their intrest is in out put .singapore and other states that transformed managed this at the cost of their democracy
17/12/2019, 12:20 - +60 12-868 2549: Good 👏
A singapore system of governance is what we need - remember they haven't changed a political party since 1959!
17/12/2019, 12:20 - +60 11-6111 5832: These are pawns in chess game. The king and castles run the country. None of them can't tell the king how to do or what is going wrong. True colours of Prof bukenya and his integrity was exposed when he was kicked out.
17/12/2019, 12:21 - +256 775 371125: Thats wat am telling you at the cost of their democracy
17/12/2019, 12:24 - +60 11-2803 7720: Don’t forget HE. Edward Kiwanuka Sekandi the VP is a learned Lawyer. 
The best of his class. 🤦🏽‍♂
17/12/2019, 12:24 - +60 17-234 7760: Just asking are you equating the great lee kwan u to my dear president.. as he put up the institutions singapore enjoys.. hence it begins with a visionary leader..
17/12/2019, 12:26 - +60 11-6111 5832: He better resign ASAP. I look at all the killings for the past decade and he says nothing as a learned  person. Not even a report
17/12/2019, 12:26 - +60 12-868 2549: 😀🤣 Great point there! Vision is key.
17/12/2019, 12:28 - +60 12-868 2549: So the intellectuals can't save us too 😥
17/12/2019, 12:28 - +60 11-6111 5832: I also believe the luxury of time mzee has and what he has at his exposure. He can do much. However trust me his agenda is different. To make sure we are easy to rule.
17/12/2019, 12:29 - +60 11-2803 7720: But you forget that a countries social structure and values are crucial to its political setup. 
Singapore’s social structure follows much of the “Confucianism” values. Leaders would rather die than messing up a country.
On the other hand, Ugandan social structure and Values follow the African Traditional society where a father is everything and even when he messes up, we just have to thank him. 
🤦🏽‍♂🤦🏽‍♂
17/12/2019, 12:33 - +60 12-868 2549: Awesome ☝️on point my brother! 
So, how to do we change that?
17/12/2019, 12:35 - +60 11-2803 7720: But Our leaders have also had a vision 1986. 
- The “Ten points program”
- Prosperity for All
- NDP 1 and 2
- Vision 2040
- Operation Wealth Creation
And so many others. 

The problem, I think the president entrusted hungry chicken to feed chicks and it made it quite difficult to see the chicks grow well. Nonetheless, the then hungry chicken are now satisfied.
17/12/2019, 12:37 - +60 12-868 2549: So, shall we hope for progress since the hungry chickens are now satisfied 👺
17/12/2019, 12:40 - +60 11-2803 7720: By nature, as long as the feeds are still available, chicken will always continue feeding. 
For them to stop, you have to either switch off the lights.
17/12/2019, 12:44 - +60 12-868 2549: 😀😀 Either switch off the lights !!! OR ?
17/12/2019, 12:44 - +60 11-2803 7720: Cut of the chicken’s head! 
I don’t want to say that 🤦🏽‍♂🤦🏽‍♂🤦🏽‍♂
17/12/2019, 12:54 - +60 12-868 2549: So you realize the problem isnt the president. In my opinion i view the president as one man or call him CEO   who has tried over time to make use of the human resources ( of all calibre) within his environment but the same human resource has consistently failed him. 
We need to remember that the CEO doesnt necessarily have to be brightest man in the nation or the strongest , but one who can work effectively & profitably with the resources at hand. Having led a successful gorrilla war - Mzee proved himself competent at leading & working through others. 
The challenge is that the same Human Resource who have deliberately  failed him seek to replace him turning their  own poor performance to his. How do we trust another set of claimed leaders when we really know that as Ugandans we have a moral & cultural problem that demands changes from within ???
17/12/2019, 13:00 - +60 12-868 2549: @60172347760 what would you do, if you were that CEO responsible to bring progress ( deliver results)  amongst a contagiously infected environment ? And well knowing that a change of CEO would most probably not change the situation as well ...
Do you change the environment as shareholders, ( _shareholders who again constitute the same environment_) and how ?
